2019-09-21,Rockfish Food & Wine,2.0,gringamex,"I had long wanted to try the Rockfish and I have to say that I was disappointed. The staff were great and, fortunately, understanding, as I had to return two items to the kitchen. The melon salad was simply the worst salad I've ever been served: the melon was rock hard and brownish, the salad leaves were mottled and bitter, and the prosciutto consisted of smalll, thick slices of fat. They replaced it with a beet salad that was a bit better, though I don't understand why there were so few beets or why they were chopped up into small bits. My second plate was drum fish and that had to be returned because it was raw, which in this type of fish means you can't even cut it. On the other hand, I loved the possibility of having a wine flight.",Saturday,"['i', 'had', 'long', 'wanted', 'to', 'try', 'the', 'rockfish', 'and', 'i', 'have', 'to', 'say', 'that', 'i', 'was', 'disappointed', 'the', 'staff', 'were', 'great', 'and', 'fortunately', 'understanding', 'as', 'i', 'had', 'to', 'return', 'two', 'items', 'to', 'the', 'kitchen', 'the', 'melon', 'salad', 'was', 'simply', 'the', 'worst', 'salad', ""i've"", 'ever', 'been', 'served', 'the', 'melon', 'was', 'rock', 'hard', 'and', 'brownish', 'the', 'salad', 'leaves', 'were', 'mottled', 'and', 'bitter', 'and', 'the', 'prosciutto', 'consisted', 'of', 'smalll', 'thick', 'slices', 'of', 'fat', 'they', 'replaced', 'it', 'with', 'a', 'beet', 'salad', 'that', 'was', 'a', 'bit', 'better', 'though', 'i', ""don't"", 'understand', 'why', 'there', 'were', 'so', 'few', 'beets', 'or', 'why', 'they', 'were', 'chopped', 'up', 'into', 'small', 'bits', 'my', 'second', 'plate', 'was', 'drum', 'fish', 'and', 'that', 'had', 'to', 'be', 'returned', 'because', 'it', 'was', 'raw', 'which', 'in', 'this', 'type', 'of', 'fish', 'means', 'you', ""can't"", 'even', 'cut', 'it', 'on', 'the', 'other', 'hand', 'i', 'loved', 'the', 'possibility', 'of', 'having', 'a', 'wine', 'flight']",142,0.028169014084507043,0.035211267605633804,Negative,Yes

2019-05-30,Rockfish Food & Wine,5.0,veracity55,"Just had our first meal at Rockfish. The hostess greeted us promptly and showed us to our table while offering us the choice of a booth if we prepared. Our waitress appeared promptly, told us about the specials and answered our questions. We started with the black bean appetizer, the only speed bump of the evening. Although tasty, it was a lot of black beans and rice and a relatively minimal amount of chorizo, tomatoes, sour cream, and sweet potato chips. The chips were what would really have elevated this had there just been enough. We both ordered a wine pairing (what a great idea - 3 half-glasses of wine for 11.00). My husband's strip steak was good, but my crab cakes were the best I've had in years - all crab instead of mostly bread. They were accompanied by a tasty spiniach and lemon viniagrette that nicely offset the somewhat spicy root vegetable hash. We finished off by sharing a slice of flourless chocolate torte. Service throughout was prompt and correct. It was pleasantly quiet so that we were able to carry on a conversation.

Even if I didn't typically like an ingredient, I felt that the dishes were good, a mark of a good chef. The parking is a bit tricky as it is all street parking and crossing from the other side of the street can be a bit difficult even at the cross-walk. Drivers are not used to slowing down there. Also, the restaurant can get quite noisy. I would try to put some noise dampening panels etc as having a conversation can be difficult. Also, they do not take reservations, so getting a seat on a Friday or Saturday might be difficult. I would definitely want to sit at the chef's table as I feel that I could hear the person next to me better as well as get to see the chefs prepare the food. So overall, the food is very good, and I think they will figure some of these other things out.",Thursday,"['i', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'this', 'restaurant', 'overall', 'my', 'wife', 'and', 'i', 'had', 'several', 'small', 'dishes', 'and', 'enjoyed', 'them', 'very', 'much', 'even', 'if', 'i', ""didn't"", 'typically', 'like', 'an', 'ingredient', 'i', 'felt', 'that', 'the', 'dishes', 'were', 'good', 'a', 'mark', 'of', 'a', 'good', 'chef', 'the', 'parking', 'is', 'a', 'bit', 'tricky', 'as', 'it', 'is', 'all', 'street', 'parking', 'and', 'crossing', 'from', 'the', 'other', 'side', 'of', 'the', 'street', 'can', 'be', 'a', 'bit', 'difficult', 'even', 'at', 'the', 'cross-walk', 'drivers', 'are', 'not', 'used', 'to', 'slowing', 'down', 'there', 'also', 'the', 'restaurant', 'can', 'get', 'quite', 'noisy', 'i', 'would', 'try', 'to', 'put', 'some', 'noise', 'dampening', 'panels', 'etc', 'as', 'having', 'a', 'conversation', 'can', 'be', 'difficult', 'also', 'they', 'do', 'not', 'take', 'reservations', 'so', 'getting', 'a', 'seat', 'on', 'a', 'friday', 'or', 'saturday', 'might', 'be', 'difficult', 'i', 'would', 'definitely', 'want', 'to', 'sit', 'at', 'the', ""chef's"", 'table', 'as', 'i', 'feel', 'that', 'i', 'could', 'hear', 'the', 'person', 'next', 'to', 'me', 'better', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'get', 'to', 'see', 'the', 'chefs', 'prepare', 'the', 'food', 'so', 'overall', 'the', 'food', 'is', 'very', 'good', 'and', 'i', 'think', 'they', 'will', 'figure', 'some', 'of', 'these', 'other', 'things', 'out']",173,0.05202312138728324,0.04046242774566474,Positive,Yes

It was crowded but the service is so excellent that it doesnt seem like very long before you are served. In the tapas environment something is always delivered for tastings. They have the best flatbread that came out immediately, so dont forget to order it even if you order one or two of the cheese plates. The chvre was especially tasty. My husband and I were going to share the beets but there were so many, everyone had a taste. Because everything comes out so beautifully displayed, it is tempting to taste, which is exactly what Bloom encourages. My Snapper was delicious and beautifully displayed with vegetables in purple onion rings. It is fun to observe what others are eating, reminiscent of European dining. This type of fresh food is not cheap, but certainly worth it. Only problem is the parking but there are places throughout the safe and up and coming neighborhood.

We had a charcuterie and cheese plate (choose your own meats and cheeses to create a personalized plate), Heirloom Tomato Salad, and Brasstown Beef. And the DESSERTS...oh my!

The service was received was absolutely HORRENDOUS:-From the time we sat down, it took literally 30 minutes to receive beverages. The first 3 choices of my date, they were out of, including a specialty drink on their menu. Additionally, the servers couldn't remember ANYTHING, and every food item/drink had to be ordered multiple times. I can't even count how many times they couldn't remember/confused things!-At one point, there were only 7 people seated, 2 persons each, and 2 servers ""working."" At this point, a guy at another table turns to us to express his disbelief that service was this bad when only 7 tables had people at them. The ""servers"" were nowhere to be found half the night, I am talking completely just gone. When they did show up, we had to order drinks/food multiple times, because they had forgot/confused it. This literally turned into a 2 hour+ dinner because the servers frequently disappeared.-1 server brought our appetizer and sat it on another table. That table told them they didnt order it, to which I said ""We ordered those"" (45 minutes ago in fact). She proceeded to lift the food off of that table circle around the restaurant and place it on ours. That's a health code violation, but I ignored it, because I wasn't waiting another 45 minutes for an appetizer. 30 minutes per beverage was bad enough too. -Outside of my date's first 3 drink requests being ""out""... I had to place an order for a mixed drink (jim beam and coke) three times!! they couldn't remember a 2 ingredient drink!-Other Patrons were openly complaining about the service. They, we, were literally discussing how ridiculous the lack of service was with other patrons... at which point, the server confused multiple table's items on one another's checks. After several back-and-forths to the register and failing to get it right, he had to take everyone's word for what they ordered.My suspicion is that the owner of the business is an incredible sushi chef, because the food itself was amazing, but the service and overall management of the place was a complete failure.

2019-06-30,Outback Steakhouse,2.0,Anne H,"We eat at this Outback restaurant very frequently. My step son used to be their kitchen manager. We've always kept an affection for it.Ate there last week with my husband-all was well. Ate there today with my son and was disappointed. Not in the food, it was fine.It was the payment and server that bothered me. My bill was $46.50.I paid with (3) $20 dollar bills.She asked if I needed change, I said yes.Was planning on leaving $8 to $10 tip when I got my change.She returned with (4) one dollar bills. My change should have been 13.50 not $4.I sort of flagged her back down and told her I had given her $60 (3 twenty dollar bills). I was absolutely positive that's what I gave because all I had were $20's.I had just gotten 10 twenty dollar bills when cashing check for $200.In fact, when I got the bill, I was searching to see if I had any smaller bills to go with the $20's and only had a few one dollar bills and the twenties.When I told her I was positive I gave her 3 twenties, she told me I was wrong. She informed me I gave her 2 twenties and a ten.I tried to tell her I know I didnt give her any $10 bill because I didn't have any.She insisted she was right and I was wrong .I was not going to cause a scene and ruin the nice lunch I had had with my son. I told her not to worry about it. She kept insisting what I gave her and it was unsettling to me that she did not even entertain the idea that she was mistaken and that perhaps I was correct. I am a small business owner myself. I do not believe, necessarily, that the customer is always right. But I do believe, that when a customer states they are sure of something, that they should at least be listened to.She gave to hint that she even remotely considered that I was right and maybe she was mistaken. $10 not worth really arguing or even continuing to discuss as she was absolutely definite about what she said I gave her.

2019-01-10,Outback Steakhouse,1.0,MrsKerren18,"On New Year's Day, we decided to have dinner at Outback in Roanoke, assuming it was open. Many restaurants were not, and it would have been better for us and Outback if they were among those that were closed. Frist, we and many others were waiting for over 30 minutes as we watched the tables empty and no one being seated. I thought table turn-over was the goal of busy restaurants, but not this one. Three hostesses who kept saying, 'you will be seated shortly'. Once we were seated, there was literally trash all around our two-seat table! paper trash, food; or should I say garbage; even liquid. There were bus-persons stationed around the dining room, just watching the empty tables. They were quick to bus them, but did not tidy up the cushions, chairs, or floor. After pointing it out to the server, who was running her tail off, we simply went back to the hostess and asked for a nearby table that was at least clean. She seated us, then conferred with a server who recommended we be reseated to a booth--no problem. This server was cheerful and seemed to be on top of things. Our salad and soup were quickly delivered and then the wait started. 30 minutes later, we asked where our 'simple' orders were - a sandwich! She said, ""soon"". Meanwhile patrons who had arrived after us were either on to their desserts, or were leaving having completed their meals.We waited longer, Finally, I went to use the restroom, and it too was a pigpen - paper and liquids everywhere--no tp in two of three stalls. Trash baskets overflowing. If I wasn't desperate by then, I would have walked out of the restaurant.On my way back to my table I noticed a dish that had just been delivered to another person, and it was unpresentable in my opinion. I decided we had wasted enough time, and my husband, having observed other disasters in my absence was also ready to leave. We took our coats, left enough money for our beverages and salads and left. There was no sign of our server, but there were more empty tables of people who had completed their meals. And there was still a long wait. We were tempted to warn people, but decided just to get out. Meanwhile, the hostesses were heard to say, ""you will be seated shortly.""And since I'm on a roll, i might mention the new remodeling inside does not contribute to ambience. I'm assuming more people can be seated, but there are fewer dividiers between tables, booths, etc, and nothing between the high tops and the entrance, leaving a continuing stream of people and cold air coming from the outside for those seated just inside the entrance. Definitely not inviting.We assumed there must be a new manager, who was invisible, since the former manager was often seen welcoming guests, checking on tables, service, etc, and we didn't see anyone doing this function - or we would have told him/her of the situation.",Thursday,"['on', 'new', ""year's"", 'day', 'we', 'decided', 'to', 'have', 'dinner', 'at', 'outback', 'in', 'roanoke', 'assuming', 'it', 'was', 'open', 'many', 'restaurants', 'were', 'not', 'and', 'it', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'for', 'us', 'and', 'outback', 'if', 'they', 'were', 'among', 'those', 'that', 'were', 'closed', 'frist', 'we', 'and', 'many', 'others', 'were', 'waiting', 'for', 'over', '30', 'minutes', 'as', 'we', 'watched', 'the', 'tables', 'empty', 'and', 'no', 'one', 'being', 'seated', 'i', 'thought', 'table', 'turn-over', 'was', 'the', 'goal', 'of', 'busy', 'restaurants', 'but', 'not', 'this', 'one', 'three', 'hostesses', 'who', 'kept', 'saying', 'you', 'will', 'be', 'seated', 'shortly', 'once', 'we', 'were', 'seated', 'there', 'was', 'literally', 'trash', 'all', 'around', 'our', 'two-seat', 'table', 'paper', 'trash', 'food', 'or', 'should', 'i', 'say', 'garbage', 'even', 'liquid', 'there', 'were', 'bus-persons', 'stationed', 'around', 'the', 'dining', 'room', 'just', 'watching', 'the', 'empty', 'tables', 'they', 'were', 'quick', 'to', 'bus', 'them', 'but', 'did', 'not', 'tidy', 'up', 'the', 'cushions', 'chairs', 'or', 'floor', 'after', 'pointing', 'it', 'out', 'to', 'the', 'server', 'who', 'was', 'running', 'her', 'tail', 'off', 'we', 'simply', 'went', 'back', 'to', 'the', 'hostess', 'and', 'asked', 'for', 'a', 'nearby', 'table', 'that', 'was', 'at', 'least', 'clean', 'she', 'seated', 'us', 'then', 'conferred', 'with', 'a', 'server', 'who', 'recommended', 'we', 'be', 'reseated', 'to', 'a', 'booth--no', 'problem', 'this', 'server', 'was', 'cheerful', 'and', 'seemed', 'to', 'be', 'on', 'top', 'of', 'things', 'our', 'salad', 'and', 'soup', 'were', 'quickly', 'delivered', 'and', 'then', 'the', 'wait', 'started', '30', 'minutes', 'later', 'we', 'asked', 'where', 'our', 'simple', 'orders', 'were', '', 'a', 'sandwich', 'she', 'said', 'soon', 'meanwhile', 'patrons', 'who', 'had', 'arrived', 'after', 'us', 'were', 'either', 'on', 'to', 'their', 'desserts', 'or', 'were', 'leaving', 'having', 'completed', 'their', 'meals.we', 'waited', 'longer', 'finally', 'i', 'went', 'to', 'use', 'the', 'restroom', 'and', 'it', 'too', 'was', 'a', 'pigpen', '', 'paper', 'and', 'liquids', 'everywhere--no', 'tp', 'in', 'two', 'of', 'three', 'stalls', 'trash', 'baskets', 'overflowing', 'if', 'i', ""wasn't"", 'desperate', 'by', 'then', 'i', 'would', 'have', 'walked', 'out', 'of', 'the', 'restaurant.on', 'my', 'way', 'back', 'to', 'my', 'table', 'i', 'noticed', 'a', 'dish', 'that', 'had', 'just', 'been', 'delivered', 'to', 'another', 'person', 'and', 'it', 'was', 'unpresentable', 'in', 'my', 'opinion', 'i', 'decided', 'we', 'had', 'wasted', 'enough', 'time', 'and', 'my', 'husband', 'having', 'observed', 'other', 'disasters', 'in', 'my', 'absence', 'was', 'also', 'ready', 'to', 'leave', 'we', 'took', 'our', 'coats', 'left', 'enough', 'money', 'for', 'our', 'beverages', 'and', 'salads', 'and', 'left', 'there', 'was', 'no', 'sign', 'of', 'our', 'server', 'but', 'there', 'were', 'more', 'empty', 'tables', 'of', 'people', 'who', 'had', 'completed', 'their', 'meals', 'and', 'there', 'was', 'still', 'a', 'long', 'wait', 'we', 'were', 'tempted', 'to', 'warn', 'people', 'but', 'decided', 'just', 'to', 'get', 'out', 'meanwhile', 'the', 'hostesses', 'were', 'heard', 'to', 'say', 'you', 'will', 'be', 'seated', 'shortly.""and', 'since', ""i'm"", 'on', 'a', 'roll', 'i', 'might', 'mention', 'the', 'new', 'remodeling', 'inside', 'does', 'not', 'contribute', 'to', 'ambience', ""i'm"", 'assuming', 'more', 'people', 'can', 'be', 'seated', 'but', 'there', 'are', 'fewer', 'dividiers', 'between', 'tables', 'booths', 'etc', 'and', 'nothing', 'between', 'the', 'high', 'tops', 'and', 'the', 'entrance', 'leaving', 'a', 'continuing', 'stream', 'of', 'people', 'and', 'cold', 'air', 'coming', 'from', 'the', 'outside', 'for', 'those', 'seated', 'just', 'inside', 'the', 'entrance', 'definitely', 'not', 'inviting.we', 'assumed', 'there', 'must', 'be', 'a', 'new', 'manager', 'who', 'was', 'invisible', 'since', 'the', 'former', 'manager', 'was', 'often', 'seen', 'welcoming', 'guests', 'checking', 'on', 'tables', 'service', 'etc', 'and', 'we', ""didn't"", 'see', 'anyone', 'doing', 'this', 'function', '', 'or', 'we', 'would', 'have', 'told', 'him/her', 'of', 'the', 'situation']",507,0.03353057199211045,0.01972386587771203,Positive,Yes

They have a Pizza Special on Tuesday evening and Sunday until 5 pm. I cannot say I love the crust but this special allows you to choose any or all of the toppings they offer, no limit. This more than makes up for the less than perfect crust. The crust is just too hard for my taste. I was there this evening with a neighbor. A couple walked by and stopped to ask if the pizza ""was as awesome to eat as it was to look at"". I had to answer ""yes"". Their salads are delicious and large with good ingredients, their burgers are mammoth and the beer battered french fries are some of the best around. I don't know why, but their sodas taste better than any I have had other places. They have opened a second location across town and hopefully it is just as good.

Their philosophy is simple; traditional dishes prepared in home-style fashion. We ordered combo 2. For the chicken breast kabob, the meat is ground and combined with a subtle blend of herbs with just a small touch of heat, then formed into textured strips (not patties or nuggets!), and braised or baked (forgot to ask) to a light brown outer shell to give the appearance of chicken kabob without a skewer..The lamb kabob is more familiar, chunks of meat with a dusting of the herbal mix and perfectly complimented with the seasoned brown rice and a side of chopped garden salad greens to cleanse the palate between bites.

The onion rings were tasty; nice and thick cut rings... the part that makes this review 3 out of 5: the chips and salsa with the cheese sauce, the salsa tasted like it had been made with sugar- eww and the cheese sauce, this was an interesting item - I was expecting something on the nacho cheese side but instead recd some sort of thick jiggling substance... the taste was a mix of bland cheese wiz and something else I couldnt put my tastebuds to... super disappointed and something that should be so simple... couldnt eat either sauce after a couple of bites ... at least the tortilla chips were crunchy? Lastly, the black beans and rice... oh my... couldnt eat a full bite... so bland, no seasoning whatsoever... an item that was for sure not tasted before serving ....I would say this wasnt an experience that would turn me off to eating there again , but I know definitely what I will not order on the second go around.

2019-08-01,Brambleton Deli,4.0,Steve L,I am going to base this review on to visit. Our first visit was a lunch date where everything was pretty much spot-on. Food was done well service was great and everything was cooked to order. The second visit was pretty much the same thing. Service was good food was good with one exception. I ordered the prime rib sandwich which is a premium sandwich on their menu. For the most part it was well done except for a bit of an off flavor with the meat. It had a freezer burnt flavor. I can understand not having fresh prime rib available all the time but I would recommend not keeping it too long if you do intend to serve it Frozen. Definitely looked like it came out of the freezer and then was finished on a flat top. It wasn't quite bad enough for me to send it back but definitely noticeable enough that I would not order that sandwich again. Outside of that no complaints.

We placed the order online for pick up an hour and a half later. We received an email confirming our pick up time, and we arrived 10 min earlier than the time on the chance it might be ready. Nope. So we waited, which was fine. It was a busy Sunday. But the pick up time came and went. We had to ask 10 min later if it was ready. It was not. Finally 15 min after the confirmed time, they brought our food out. We had to ask for utensils. Then realized they forgot one of the sides but thankfully we checked before we left the lot. The hostess was rude when she brought me the side. No apology, nothing, not for the late order and not for the missing item. I wish I could have asked for the tip back that I had added when I ordered and paid online. My husband loved his Tuscan chicken pizza, and my bbq pork was good but I would have liked more bbq sauce.

2019-09-30,Remini's,5.0,Linda W,"Once again, while visiting in Roanoke, we planned dinner Saturday evening at 5pm with our kids and grandchildren. We were so happy to get a reservation so we knew we would have a table for the kiddos, and we love the cool calm back room. We got first class service from Hannah G, who was all over us, keeping us in drinks, keeping the table clear, quickly bringing as well as refilling their fabulous warm bread baskets with kind of pesto olive oil dip that I love! She was also accepting that we brought a McDonald's burger for the toddler since he wasn't up for their upscale kind. We again chose the family style meals, which come with a big salad plate for each entree, and I am not exaggerating, that the Caesar salad at Remini's is the BEST EVER! I was beyond amazed that my 18 month old grandson accepted pieces of that salad and ate 8 of them!! We love the fettucini alfredo chicken, and the chicken parmesan as entrees.

Jenn took fabulous care of us, welcomed us and the children with wonderful hot parmesan bread, which was to die for! She made recommendations about the family style portions, and how wonderful the Caesar salad was, and she usually doesn't like Caesar salads. There are family style dinners for $20.99 which is a large salad, soooo good, and a platter with pasta and entree for $20.99, listed for 2, but would feed 3, maybe 3.5. So we got two and tried both, the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken, and the Chicken Parmesan on pasta, plus meatballs. There was lot of xtra for the four adults, and our kids were excited to have lots leftover for lunches this week. Huge shout out again to Jenn for keeping us in drinks and every little thing.

We were seated in the side room to the right. Not in the big attractive left side. When we got in there it was miserably hot. They claimed it was too hot outside for their air conditioning to catch up. They stated that it was 80. My phone read 88. It was so hot that our ice melted in our drinks three times in the hour and a half that we were there. Thankfully we had a good waitress. By the time the food got there, I was hot, sweaty and nauseous. I didnt end up eating. There were other small issues but at the risk of sounding petty I wont mention them.

Waitress was obviously overloaded but did an excellent job given the crowd. The manager was on the floor trying to help. Food quality and service has gone down since our last visit.

2018-03-17,Thai Oudone Valley Grill,5.0,Aaron Q,"I've eaten at Thai Oudone several times, now, both inside and takeout. Thai Oudone differs from the other, several Thai restaurants in the area in that it feels more like a takeout Chinese restaurant when you go inside. It lacks that dim, ornate atmosphere that most Thai restaurants have. And, yeah, that can be important to a dining experience for special occasions. But I eat Thai food enough that I'm really just concerned about two things 1) the quality of the food, and 2) having decent staff in the restaurant if I'm eating in. That said, Thai Oudone staff has always been polite and attentive, which I cannot always say for staff at at leats one other Thai restaurant in the area, which I stopped eating at because of their staff on repeat visits. I almost always get a curry dish, usually red curry. What Thai Oudone seems to excel at is getting ""spicy"" right! Their ""hot scale"" runs from 1 to 5, which is much better than a limited two-pepper icon on a traditional Thai menu or otherwise trying to communicate, subjectively, how spicy you want. Having a 1 to 5 scale means they are used to a varying degree of spiciness and standardize it in a way that repeat customers can easily accustom themselves to. Keeping heat in mind, I have never gone above a 3, and I like spicy food! I won't say that everytime I've ordered a 2 or something between a 2 and a 3 that it's exactly the same, but I can say I've pushed my enjoyability level with a 3 before and don't care to go beyond it. Portion sizes are also good, which is something very important to me. There is a Thai restaurant in walking distance from me that I don't eat at anymore because I always leave feeling hungry after cleaning my plate. At Thai Oudone, I almost always have leftovers. And in my opinion, Thai food is one of the few foods that not only taste good the next day but often somehow tastes better! Their Thai menu is smaller than other Thai restaurants in the area, I think, but they compensate that with a Chinese-food section and a Laos section. So, they have a little more than just Thai food or did last time I looked at a menu (I usually just order without looking).Their prices tend to be just a bit lower than traditional sit-down Thai restaurants, from my experience, and they don't skimp on the food. When I/we order from here, it's usually takeout. I don't do takeout at other Thai restaurants for some reason. I guess this place is set up for it and comes across like they intend for a lot of take out business. Certainly their dining area is small and limited, so if they are busy and you wish to dine inside, seating might be hard to come by. However, I've yet to not get a seat in there nor have I had to wait to be seated as of yet. I believe they are closed on Mondays, which is typical of other Thai restaurants, as I recall. Don't drive out without being sure they are open. These type of restaurants also tend to close for family-related things or during vacations, so if you're driving more than several minutes for your first time and are planning on eating in, since it's a bit out of the way (near Botetourt), it can't hurt to call and be sure they are open, though chances are they would be.",Saturday,"[""i've"", 'eaten', 'at', 'thai', 'oudone', 'several', 'times',

Having just come out of the woods after a few days, we were ready for a quality meal. We sat outside on a cute neighborhood block. Abraham greeted us with water, THANKFULLY.. it was a rough hike out, and after a quick orientation, we ordered a local wine. After asking his opinion, he directed us to a different white wine, with explanation, and then we knew we were in good hands. We ordered the oysters, which were Rappahannock (from the Chesapeake bay) with peach and ginger mignonette... delightful, especially with the Virginia Albario! (His reco- and 1/2 price wine happy hour)We then had the pork belly BLT with cucumber Aioli and Kennebec potatoes- which Abraham explained why these local potatoes were important to the fry world. We finished off with the flat bread of the day with turkey confit, potatoes, squash, local micro greens... kale, too. We asked for his reco on a red- he brought us a Sangiovese from Umbria- excellent pairing! The food is all locally sourced and well prepared, the ambiance was friendly and warm and the service from Abraham was exquisite. I asked a lot of questions and he answered them with patience and added value to the answers. We learned about the oysters, the local Virgina wine scene, and he even recommended a hiking/ camping spot that we will check out in the near future.

So, as a small gesture of appreciation we took my wife's sister and husband to Our Daily Bread. My wife and I had not had Eggs Benedict in some time so we both ordered the same. 'This' was Eggs Benedict like we never had before. The eggs were the freshest I've ever eaten and cooked to absolute perfection. I've never had butter that tasted this creamy before. Instead of an English Muffin the restaurant serves this dish with the eggs and Canadian bacon sitting on half a freshly in house baked croissant. The other half I buttered with some of the fabulous butter they use for cooking their meals (simply delicious!). And, the Hollandaise Sauce was like the rest of the meal, superb!

The buffet was excellent, yet not extensive. See pics. Good green salads and Masala Vadaithe latter larger and softer than typically offered on South Indian buffets and delightfully devoured with tasty gusto. Piles of Naan. A special mango Kesari (Saffron) dessert that begged for seconds and third helpings! An unusual feature was a listing of cocktails involving Indian ingredients such as Smoked Cumin, Curry leaves and the like. I really enjoyed their Curry Leaf and Cumin Martini and my spouse savored their Indian Cosmopolitan. In the four decades I have dined at Indian restaurants in two dozen states never have I been as enthralled with such a mixed drink.

2019-06-04,Taaza Indian Cuisine,2.0,42georgei,"Went with a large group (19) for dinner, as a reservation. This was not this first time this group had been there and it has always been great in the past..... unfortunately this was not the case this time. Our group of 19 had one waiter, who not once asked if we wanted refills on drinks, but was instead flagged down to ask for refills, or we simply went to the bar instead of waiting. When our food came, one order was completely wrong, and they brought only 4 bowls of rice for our entire party. All of these things very minimal and was easy to overlook, until the end of our evening... our waiter was no where to be found, and after our table literally had been cleaned off for 45 minutes, one of the members of our party walked half way across the restaurant to tell him we would like to have our checks... he said sure... 20 minutes later, he walked out to our table with a 4 foot receipt in his hand and went around our table and asked each person what they had and made marks on the paper, then disappears... again... another 20 minutes go by, and we ask for our checks.. again... another 15 minutes later he finally comes out holding a stack of receipts, at this point its 9:00 and were all holding our cards ready. Then he starts again, asking what we each had... he hands out two checks, then gets to the third person at the table and hes confused... he skips her and moves on to the next, has several other checks correct and then stops.... he walked around to the front of the table and said can I just ring it all up together and divide it evenly..... NO! Some people had multiple orders drinks or appetizers, others just had drinks... absolutely not ok.. at this point weve been there 2.5 hours, this is not ok.. he fumbles with the checks in his hand and said uh I dont know what to do, can you each come to the bar and tell me what you ordered.... so all 19 of us stood up in a line.. one by one we began telling him our orders... again... he was so confused at this point the manager came to assist him. Mind you theyre only using one computer to have us check out one at a time... multiple people had to tell them several times what they got... by the time they got to me it was 9:45, third to the last one in line, Then their computer crashes... I give him my order and he takes my card and disappears, Im assuming to another computer, 10 minutes go by and he finally returns with two checks... I had two beers, an entree and bread.. on one check was my food and one beer, on the second, my second beer... he tells me I have to sign both because he ran my card two times.... 3.5 hours later we finally walked out of the restaurant... I understand we had a large party, but 1.5 hours to get our checks and pay is absolutely ridiculous... the food was incredible, but that scenario is enough to make me not want to return.",Tuesday,"['went', 'with', 'a', 'large', 'group', '19', 'for', 'dinner', 'as', 'a', 'reservation', 'this', 'was', 'not', 'this', 'first', 'time', 'this', 'group', 'had', 'been', 'there', 'and', 'it', 'has', 'always', 'been', 'great', 'in', 'the', 'past', 'unfortunately', 'this', 'was', 'not', 'the', 'case', 'this', 'time', 'our', 'group', 'of', '19', 'had', 'one', 'waiter', 'who', 'not', 'once', 'asked', 'if', 'we', 'wanted', 'refills', 'on', 'drinks', 'but', 'was', 'instead', 'flagged', 'down', 'to', 'ask', 'for', 'refills', 'or', 'we', 'simply', 'went', 'to', 'the', 'bar', 'instead', 'of', 'waiting', 'when', 'our', 'food', 'came', 'one', 'order', 'was', 'completely', 'wrong', 'and', 'they', 'brought', 'only', '4', 'bowls', 'of', 'rice', 'for', 'our', 'entire', 'party', 'all', 'of', 'these', 'things', 'very', 'minimal', 'and', 'was', 'easy', 'to', 'overlook', 'until', 'the', 'end', 'of', 'our', 'evening', 'our', 'waiter', 'was', 'no', 'where', 'to', 'be', 'found', 'and', 'after', 'our', 'table', 'literally', 'had', 'been', 'cleaned', 'off', 'for', '45', 'minutes', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'members', 'of', 'our', 'party', 'walked', 'half', 'way', 'across', 'the', 'restaurant', 'to', 'tell', 'him', 'we', 'would', 'like', 'to', 'have', 'our', 'checks', 'he', 'said', 'sure', '20', 'minutes', 'later', 'he', 'walked', 'out', 'to', 'our', 'table', 'with', 'a', '4', 'foot', 'receipt', 'in', 'his', 'hand', 'and', 'went', 'around', 'our', 'table', 'and', 'asked', 'each', 'person', 'what', 'they', 'had', 'and', 'made', 'marks', 'on', 'the', 'paper', 'then', 'disappears', 'again', 'another', '20', 'minutes', 'go', 'by', 'and', 'we', 'ask', 'for', 'our', 'checks', 'again', 'another', '15', 'minutes', 'later', 'he', 'finally', 'comes', 'out', 'holding', 'a', 'stack', 'of', 'receipts', 'at', 'this', 'point', 'its', '9:00', 'and', 'were', 'all', 'holding', 'our', 'cards', 'ready', 'then', 'he', 'starts', 'again', 'asking', 'what', 'we', 'each', 'had', 'he', 'hands', 'out', 'two', 'checks', 'then', 'gets', 'to', 'the', 'third', 'person', 'at', 'the', 'table', 'and', 'hes', 'confused', 'he', 'skips', 'her', 'and', 'moves', 'on', 'to', 'the', 'next', 'has', 'several', 'other', 'checks', 'correct', 'and', 'then', 'stops', 'he', 'walked', 'around', 'to', 'the', 'front', 'of', 'the', 'table', 'and', 'said', 'can', 'i', 'just', 'ring', 'it', 'all', 'up', 'together', 'and', 'divide', 'it', 'evenly', 'no', 'some', 'people', 'had', 'multiple', 'orders', 'drinks', 'or', 'appetizers', 'others', 'just', 'had', 'drinks', 'absolutely', 'not', 'ok', 'at', 'this', 'point', 'weve', 'been', 'there', '2.5', 'hours', 'this', 'is', 'not', 'ok', 'he', 'fumbles', 'with', 'the', 'checks', 'in', 'his', 'hand', 'and', 'said', 'uh', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'what', 'to', 'do', 'can', 'you', 'each', 'come', 'to', 'the', 'bar', 'and', 'tell', 'me', 'what', 'you', 'ordered', 'so', 'all', '19', 'of', 'us', 'stood', 'up', 'in', 'a', 'line', 'one', 'by', 'one', 'we', 'began', 'telling', 'him', 'our', 'orders', 'again', 'he', 'was', 'so', 'confused', 'at', 'this', 'point', 'the', 'manager', 'came', 'to', 'assist', 'him', 'mind', 'you', 'theyre', 'only', 'using', 'one', 'computer', 'to', 'have', 'us', 'check', 'out', 'one', 'at', 'a', 'time', 'multiple', 'people', 'had', 'to', 'tell', 'them', 'several', 'times', 'what', 'they', 'got', 'by', 'the', 'time', 'they', 'got', 'to', 'me', 'it', 'was', '9:45', 'third', 'to', 'the', 'last', 'one', 'in', 'line', 'then', 'their', 'computer', 'crashes', 'i', 'give', 'him', 'my', 'order', 'and', 'he', 'takes', 'my', 'card', 'and', 'disappears', 'im', 'assuming', 'to', 'another', 'computer', '10', 'minutes', 'go', 'by', 'and', 'he', 'finally', 'returns', 'with', 'two', 'checks', 'i', 'had', 'two', 'beers', 'an', 'entree', 'and', 'bread', 'on', 'one', 'check', 'was', 'my', 'food', 'and', 'one', 'beer', 'on', 'the', 'second', 'my', 'second', 'beer', 'he', 'tells', 'me', 'i', 'have', 'to', 'sign', 'both', 'because', 'he', 'ran', 'my', 'card', 'two', 'times', '3.5', 'hours', 'later', 'we', 'finally', 'walked', 'out', 'of', 'the', 'restaurant', 'i', 'understand', 'we', 'had', 'a', 'large', 'party', 'but', '1.5', 'hours', 'to', 'get', 'our', 'checks', 'and', 'pay', 'is', 'absolutely', 'ridiculous', 'the', 'food', 'was', 'incredible', 'but', 'that', 'scenario', 'is', 'enough', 'to', 'make', 'me', 'not', 'want', 'to', 'return']",550,0.02,0.005454545454545455,Positive,Yes

My wife went up and complaigned. We were them seated immediately. After waiting 5 minutes with no service we went and looked at the buffet. What a joke it waz. Everything was picked over and empty.

2018-10-12,Roanoke Room at the Hotel Roanoke,4.0,Lalo_de_Mexico,"I am reviewing our single experience with the weekday buffet in The Regency Room. I don't know why TripAdvisor is referring to Roanoke Room.Having arranged a lingering lunch reunion with friends in the Roanoke area, we didn't try The Regency Room for other meals. The charm and elegance of the place left us wanting to return for dinner.Every picture on Hotel Roanoke's website is accurate. The Regency Room is a beautiful part of a beautiful building. I doubt Roanoke has a more attractive place for a special event.Reserve your table, as we did the day before when checking into the hotel. Hotel Roanoke ""and Conference Center"" has meaning. We appreciate our waiter's alert when he saw us settling into conversation about 10 minutes before a conference lunch break. Conference attendees share the room and the buffet line, so he warned us to beat the rush.Attractively presented mostly in a discreet area separate from the main dining room, the food offerings included several special teats for people like me and two of my guests, native Virginians whose mothers provided not one, not two, but multiple fresh vegetables and salads from our well-tended farm gardens. For ""company,"" pickles and relishes graced the bounty. Although my mother would never have served such things from fruit jars, Hotel Roanoke made us feel like company.Spoonbread was a standout, long overdue after 40+ years in Texas, served with Virginia succotash of limas and corn. Those two items alone produced two trips to the buffet from our table. Asparagus and mushrooms are other standouts from our lunch, as were black-eyed peas.Oddly but significantly, and I asked my wife today, we remember nothing about the meat we had. We can't even remember which meat we had at the famous Regency Room buffet. Hmmm.... Much the same applies to desserts, which were the same as other places or simply not interesting. Believe me, Virginia has desserts.Our Roanoke area friends pointed out, twice, that the buffet is better on weekends and holidays. I wish we could try them.We have an important negative, unfortunately. Although the restaurant advertises 11:30 - 2:00 p.m. for the lunch buffet, multiple employees interrupted our experience by starting a 1:00 p.m. tear-down. For the price and the setting, we think that distraction was inappropriate. The beautiful salad table was destroyed and taken away, with its tasty contents redistributed in and among what had been attractive food displays in the other room. The restaurant subtracted one hour from our otherwise excellent experience with no reduction in price. This should not have happened, and I believe it happened because of scheduled lunch time for the conference.",Friday,"['i', 'am', 'reviewing', 'our', 'single', 'experience', 'with', 'the', 'weekday', 'buffet', 'in', 'the', 'regency', 'room', 'i', ""don't"", 'know', 'why', 'tripadvisor', 'is', 'referring', 'to', 'roanoke', 'room.having', 'arranged', 'a', 'lingering', 'lunch', 'reunion', 'with', 'friends', 'in', 'the', 'roanoke', 'area', 'we', ""didn't"", 'try', 'the', 'regency', 'room', 'for', 'other', 'meals', 'the', 'charm', 'and', 'elegance', 'of', 'the', 'place', 'left', 'us', 'wanting', 'to', 'return', 'for', 'dinner.every', 'picture', 'on', 'hotel', ""roanoke's"", 'website', 'is', 'accurate', 'the', 'regency', 'room', 'is', 'a', 'beautiful', 'part', 'of', 'a', 'beautiful', 'building', 'i', 'doubt', 'roanoke', 'has', 'a', 'more', 'attractive', 'place', 'for', 'a', 'special', 'event.reserve', 'your', 'table', 'as', 'we', 'did', 'the', 'day', 'before', 'when', 'checking', 'into', 'the', 'hotel', 'hotel', 'roanoke', 'and', 'conference', 'center', 'has', 'meaning', 'we', 'appreciate', 'our', ""waiter's"", 'alert', 'when', 'he', 'saw', 'us', 'settling', 'into', 'conversation', 'about', '10', 'minutes', 'before', 'a', 'conference', 'lunch', 'break', 'conference', 'attendees', 'share', 'the', 'room', 'and', 'the', 'buffet', 'line', 'so', 'he', 'warned', 'us', 'to', 'beat', 'the', 'rush.attractively', 'presented', 'mostly', 'in', 'a', 'discreet', 'area', 'separate', 'from', 'the', 'main', 'dining', 'room', 'the', 'food', 'offerings', 'included', 'several', 'special', 'teats', 'for', 'people', 'like', 'me', 'and', 'two', 'of', 'my', 'guests', 'native', 'virginians', 'whose', 'mothers', 'provided', 'not', 'one', 'not', 'two', 'but', 'multiple', 'fresh', 'vegetables', 'and', 'salads', 'from', 'our', 'well-tended', 'farm', 'gardens', 'for', 'company', 'pickles', 'and', 'relishes', 'graced', 'the', 'bounty', 'although', 'my', 'mother', 'would', 'never', 'have', 'served', 'such', 'things', 'from', 'fruit', 'jars', 'hotel', 'roanoke', 'made', 'us', 'feel', 'like', 'company.spoonbread', 'was', 'a', 'standout', 'long', 'overdue', 'after', '40', 'years', 'in', 'texas', 'served', 'with', 'virginia', 'succotash', 'of', 'limas', 'and', 'corn', 'those', 'two', 'items', 'alone', 'produced', 'two', 'trips', 'to', 'the', 'buffet', 'from', 'our', 'table', 'asparagus', 'and', 'mushrooms', 'are', 'other', 'standouts', 'from', 'our', 'lunch', 'as', 'were', 'black-eyed', 'peas.oddly', 'but', 'significantly', 'and', 'i', 'asked', 'my', 'wife', 'today', 'we', 'remember', 'nothing', 'about', 'the', 'meat', 'we', 'had', 'we', ""can't"", 'even', 'remember', 'which', 'meat', 'we', 'had', 'at', 'the', 'famous', 'regency', 'room', 'buffet', 'hmmm', 'much', 'the', 'same', 'applies', 'to', 'desserts', 'which', 'were', 'the', 'same', 'as', 'other', 'places', 'or', 'simply', 'not', 'interesting', 'believe', 'me', 'virginia', 'has', 'desserts.our', 'roanoke', 'area', 'friends', 'pointed', 'out', 'twice', 'that', 'the', 'buffet', 'is', 'better', 'on', 'weekends', 'and', 'holidays', 'i', 'wish', 'we', 'could', 'try', 'them.we', 'have', 'an', 'important', 'negative', 'unfortunately', 'although', 'the', 'restaurant', 'advertises', '11:30', '', '2:00', 'p.m', 'for', 'the', 'lunch', 'buffet', 'multiple', 'employees', 'interrupted', 'our', 'experience', 'by', 'starting', 'a', '1:00', 'p.m', 'tear-down', 'for', 'the', 'price', 'and', 'the', 'setting', 'we', 'think', 'that', 'distraction', 'was', 'inappropriate', 'the', 'beautiful', 'salad', 'table', 'was', 'destroyed', 'and', 'taken', 'away', 'with', 'its', 'tasty', 'contents', 'redistributed', 'in', 'and', 'among', 'what', 'had', 'been', 'attractive', 'food', 'displays', 'in', 'the', 'other', 'room', 'the', 'restaurant', 'subtracted', 'one', 'hour', 'from', 'our', 'otherwise', 'excellent', 'experience', 'with', 'no', 'reduction', 'in', 'price', 'this', 'should', 'not', 'have', 'happened', 'and', 'i', 'believe', 'it', 'happened', 'because', 'of', 'scheduled', 'lunch', 'time', 'for', 'the', 'conference']",438,0.04794520547945205,0.01141552511415525,Positive,Yes

The menu is available online and I suggest that diners have a look before committing to this restaurant. The cuisine is not traditional Italian, it has a more gourmet or ""foodie"" vibe and the prices are higher than usual due to that. We enjoyed tasting the grilled octopus that one of our more adventurous members ordered. The pizza was very good with an extremely tasty crust.

This was our 1st time having real ramen and it did not disappoint! The food is so good that I was already thinking ahead and getting excited about what I'm going to get next time!

2018-05-29,Peter's Seafood,3.0,Steve L,"Went there for lunch today, ordered the shrimp dinner with fries and hush puppies. This was a first visit so I based my knowledge of it on reviews. The pictures of the shrimp dinner I saw online, looked outstanding, and indeed the food was very good. Everything was cooked to order and ready when I arrived. The plate I received was a wee bit skimpy compared to other pictures I've seen in reviews. The other issue I had was that the dinner is supposed to come with nine shrimp according to their menu, but I only received 8. I wonder if this is something specific to lunch. In the end the quality is top-notch and the preparation is fine. Not the most friendly people in the world, pretty much business all the way. Also, if you want condiments, make sure you ask for them.

First time pretty good, second time-we will never go again!We walk in, no hello unless you call being greeted by saying, ""take out or sitting down?"" I answered sitting down if ok and the ""lady"" says ok.I ordered a shrimp po-boy with fries. I couldn't make the ""lady"" understand that I wanted mayonnaise, not tartar sauce. I had to accept the tartar sauce.My wife ordered a Cod sandwich and fries. The ""lady"" left to go to the kitchen. Within 10 seconds my wife changed her mind and opened the kitchen door and told her she wanted the shrimp, the same as I was getting. Instead she got chewed out because she had opened the door of the kitchen and had not rang the bell on the counter. The bell was not seen or we would have rang it. My meal comes out, no mayonnaise-just tartar sauce.Her meal comes out and the young man that brought it out said that was what he was told to cook and we said that is okay, we can make the po-boy can you just bring a hoagie roll, lettuce and tomato and mayonnaise for her. The young man apologized and immediately brought back the needed items to make the sandwich, with tartar sauce.The ""lady"" came out and immediately started with, ""I get you what you ordered"" and I said no you did not. I explained what was said and not wanting to hear any of that she immediately takes off to the kitchen to explain to the young man that my wife had an attitude when she came in and that she is a liar. Yes, we heard it all through the very thin swinging doors. She didn't say it once but several times for all to hear.From that point on the young man took care of us. While the food was good, the service from the ""lady"" was terrible and for that reason we will not go back for more of her punishment. I would have complained but I fear she is the owner.While the food was pretty good, her service was terrible, unlike that of the young man that was caught in the middle and took care of us very well. I would have left a tip but I feared she would have stolen it from who deserved it.The reviews seem to pretty darned good for this restaurant but we were one set of only four people that came in between 11:45 and 12:30...perhaps we came at the wrong time?

Friend and I shared a western omelet and an order of ""fluffy french toast"" and I recommend both. Nothing prepared in advance and nothing prepackaged from a freezer. The only negative, and it's a small one, is that coffee is a bit weak. Because it was my first visit, I perused the menu for other offerings and I saw plenty of items that require another visit.

2017-02-19,Full Moon Cafe,4.0,AmosC_13,"This place is actually located on Electric Avenue. We have driven by several times and decided to try it for lunch one day.It is in a building attached to Cafe Asia 2. You can park right in front of the restaurant. Thus, parking is not a problem. The place is a decent size with several tables. It is also very clean.When you walk in, you try to figure out if you should sit down and wait to be served or not. Actually, you go to the counter and place your order. They will bring your food to you when it is ready. The concern is that the little old gentleman who took our order would get it right. He scribbled it down on a note pad. I guess we were lucky it was not busy because our order came out correctly.The menu is breakfast sandwiches and also deli sandwiches. We had th Italian sub, and a couple of chicken wraps. They have lunch specials. The four of us agreed that the sandwiches and wraps were slightly above average. The prices were slightly on the high side. So, this is not a value meal.When we were ready to leave, we went back up to the counter to pay...no check.

My husband (who is not finicky) said ""could they really have over a hundred friends & relatives who gave them 4 or 5 stars??? Because it can't be based on this food....!!!"" Truly, this was the least-authentic Thai food that we have had (and we've easily eaten at over a hundred Thai restaurants in the past 30 years). It was more like a very bland Americanized Chinese. Even though we ordered each dish ""spicy to medium hot"" it was bland and mild. We asked for a spice tray to attempt to remedy, but its hard to salvage dishes that were this poor.

My eggplant was superb, the special of veal chop was also great. The typical Italian dishes like veal Marsala, were also great. What was most impressive with a party of 12 was that every meal was hot and fixed to perfection. Each meal came with a fresh salad and bread. My serving was so large that I toke a doggie bag home. My husband and I shared the chocolate cake which was a chocoholics delight. Part of that went home too. The staff is very attentive and friendly.

2019-02-15,Luigi's Italian Gourmet Restaurant,1.0,harrietws2017,"Absolutely horrible experience all the way around!! My husband and I ate here for our Valentine's dinner. Luigi's has been wonderful in the past and we were expecting a very nice dinner for two. We made reservations for six and arrived right on time. As we arrived, we could see 2 empty tables in the dinning room and were surprised when we were not seated at either one. Intstead we were shown to the bar and told we would have to wait for a table. The bar is very small and cramped and they allow smoking. There was a woman at the front end of the bar puffing away. We sat in the bar for fifteen minutes drinking a glass of wine while we watched the two empty tables in the dinning room stay empty. Finally, my husband went to ask why we were not being seated and he was told that they would seat us in a few minutes. We then watched as the shoe-horned a table in the corner and set it up for us. The bartender made us pay for our wine before we could be seated which meant two seperate tickets for the evening. The other two tables remained empty for another 30 minutes. There were only two waiters for the entire dining room and the service was slow to non existant. When our salads came, we found them to be cheaply done and mostly iceberg lettuce that was wilted and warm. My husband ordered a surf and turf type meal. The steak was nearly raw and so full of fat and gristle that the table shook when he tried to cut it. The surf part of the meal was only 2 lousy shrimp placed on top of the steak. I ordered the lamb chop which looked great when delivered, but when I cut into it, it was so raw as to be still cold in the middle. It then took us ten minutes to find a waiter to get it sent back to the kitchen to be cooked. When it came back it had been microwaved. It was hot finally, but it tasted rubbery. It also had a great deal of fat and gristle to it. The tiramasu I ordered for dessert was also not good as it was thick and gloppy. The dinning room was so crowded that I wondered if the fire marshall would have approved. It was also very noisy and hardly the nice evening out that we wanted or expected. Luigi's is very pricey and when I pay those kind of prices I expect good service and good food. Last night, I got neither. I have had better meals at Burger King! I believe that the ownership of Luigi's got greedy and over booked, ordered cheap supplies and short staffed their restaurant. They used to be a good place to eat.

The Antipasto plate for two, at $15.95, had a nice selection; the portion of eggplant parmesan turned out to be the star of this dish for us. The Salmon special of the day, at $34.95, tasted as good a the freshly caught salmon we have had right out of the water in Alaska, and the Veal Saltimbocca, priced at $20.95, was served in a rich sauce. Our waiter, Mark, was a delight; he and most of the other staff have been here or years. We enjoyed discovering that he recently went skydiving, as my wife recently did.

It's a two-way country buffet. You can order a meat -- anything from sandwich to steak -- and then add the buffet bar for a nominal price. Or you can do as we do: skip the meat and focus on the salads, veggies, and desserts for $7.99 plus coffee or tea. My all-time favorite veggie is what I call scalloped tomatoes (stewed tomatoes cooked with sugar and chunks of yeast rolls). There's a bar for building a traditional salad, along with slaw, potato salad, fruit salad, and such. Vegs include sweet potato casserole, mashed potatoes, corn, okra, mac and cheese, and lots of others. There's a different soup each day of the week. Desserts include cobblers and creamy puddings, soft ice cream, brownie bites. I give top ratings to every location where we've eaten, including this one in Roanoke along with Brambleton Avenue. On this trip we also ate in Christiansburg. At other times, we've eaten in Orange and Harrisonburg and probably another place or two.

It was late by the time we decided to eat dinner so I will say that maybe some of the ""drier"" buffet foods were due to the fact we were eating later than usual. Having said that, this place was packed. The staff was friendly and took us to a booth/table. Sadly, we were seated (very closely) to a large group of loud and obnoxious teenage boys. Throughout our meal, they were yelling, laughing and making fun of other customers. This completely ruined our meal. Watching them stand behind a particular older man and mimicking his eating was disgusting. I kept wishing that management or the waitress would say something to them but in management's defense, one of their mother's was sitting one table over and never said a word to them. We couldn't really enjoy our food with that disrespectful ruckus going on so close and right next to us, but the fried shrimp we ordered was good, the buffet was average, I'm sure the late hour was the reason some of the items were a bit dry on the buffet and the price was right.

There were many vegetarian options, chicken dishes as well as small steamed clams, shrimp dish and a fish dish. I was very pleasantly surprised for the cost!! Also many beef and pork dishes I couldn't try. I happen to be handicapped and dining alone.

2019-10-06,Cuban Island,5.0,Michael L,"First off let me say that this is truly a must place to go for a great meal with excellent service and to add probably one of the cleanest restaurants you will ever experience!you will always be greeted as if coming to someones home, by the husband and wife who are hands on proprietors. The food is always fresh , and a large selection of daily specials. SO SUCCESSFUL THAT THEY HAD TO MOVE AND OPEN A MUCH LARGER LOCATION !!!!I have been eating at this restaurant for a couple years now, since I visit Roanoke for business. I felt that it was my obligation to make a comment about a 1 star review from DMARTIN1975. To start I am Cuban and live in Miami ""Little Havana"" , 1)with respect to DMARTIN1975 COMMENT, ""Congri"" is actually MADE WITH ""RED BEANS"" mixed and cooked with rice !!!!! NOT black beans !!!2)The ""BLACK BEANS ""and rice mixed is called ""MOROS Y CRISTIANOS"" or ""MOROS"" for short , so DMARTIN1975 has no clue as what he is talking about. 3)there are many variations of croquetas, which is basically a Cuban fast food normally ate at a place that sells cafecito cubano (Cuban coffee, similar to expresso but better)along with other cuban patries, and/or type of sandwich made called a ""croqueta preparada"" or just as an appetizer.again you can eat anywhere in Miami and you will see what I mean. everyone has their tastes , doesnt make it gross !!4)AS FAR AS TAMALES ,again like croquetas , they all are different, its a simple Cuban fast food, that is made from ground corn, with some pieces of pork, DMARTIN1975 mentioned it was not Cuban but Central American, let me say that in Central America they make much better tamales than Cuban tamales , and I say that as a Cuban. So do not listen to DMARTIN1975, who just recently started 2019 to review, and a possible motive behind the false and incorrect claims.

The decor is simple enough and clean. Easy access good parking. It's a seat yourself location so no problems with that and I was greeted immediately and had my drink order taken. I ordered a sausage and cheese omelette with home fries and a biscuit all of which were prepared perfectly. I especially like the home fries which had quite an amazing texture and we're definitely made from homemade and the biscuit was outstanding. The Omelette was equally well made. One thing of note is that the service here is top-notch. I overheard one waitress who was stressing over making sure that a call in order was completed to the customer's specifications.

It is a taco truck next to a grocery store on Williamson road. There is indoor seating. The food is AMAZING. I had the asada steak sopas (photo attached). Sopas are fried corn tortilla-ish. The sopa is much thicker than a traditional corn tortilla. Everything was perfectly cooked. You get 3 sopas with the order. My husband had the lengua burrito. Some of the meat was used in his rice. I'd never tried lengua before and it tasted like a very flavorful stewed beef. The burrito was huge and came with a side of rice and a small salad. With any dish, you get your choice of meats. My plan is to eat my way through their whole menu and try everything. Not all at once, of course!To drink I had horchata. I ADORE horchata. If you've never tried it, you should. It's a rice milk sort of drink that tastes like Christmas to me. If you are unsure of what anything is on the menu, the staff is very helpful. Overall...tell your friends about this place.

2019-09-23,Texas Roadhouse,2.0,SpiderEffect,"This Texas Roadhouse sits high on a hill in Roanoke, with a winding and gear churning trek to get to the parking lot. For those not familiar with the area, the best way to get to the restaurant is to go travel into the Lowe's parking lot and head up the hill. Never have we gone to Texas Roadhouse and NOT had to wait to be seated. Now - that is not to say that they were packed....far from it. You can enter the restaurant and see 5-10 booths plus some tables open and waiting on customers, but you will still receive a buzzer and will have to wait. Why??? Not really sure....you can ask, but it seems to dumbfound the hostesses when you ask why there are tons of empty tables. Let's talk about the Hamburger Steak. It is a staple for my husband. He absolutely must have one when dining out. We have tried repeatedly to order a Hamburger Steak at this location and they have NEVER gotten it cooked correctly. I will talk specifically on our recent visit. This visit was just the two of us....which is pretty unusual but we are enjoying some empty nesting in our home. Upon arriving - the parking lot had maybe 20 cars in the lot. It was around 4pm and a little early for the dinner rush. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait in spite of counting 10 tables/booths wide open and waiting to be filled. I am going to assume it was the 'changing of the guard' as I call it. The time when there is a shift change and they are balancing out patrons to waitresses/waiters. When we were seated, we immediately ordered because my husband is a creature of habit. We ordered an appetizer and drinks in case this trip ended up like the other 10 attempts to get a decent hamburger steak. I always order a chicken dish because their smothered chicken is so delicious!When the waitress brought out our meal, the hamburger steak was burned. Let me paint the picture.....the steak was literally so black it looked like the asphalt in the parking lot. After a few muttered cuss words, my husband took his fork and tapped the steak.....you could literally hear a 'ping' when the fork touched the meat. After flagging down the waitress, a manager came over stating she saw the order come out and was trying to find who had the burned hamburger steak. After handing it to her, the manager proceeded to peel the burned area and simply said 'I have no words'. The steak was taken back and we waited. We had friends sitting at a neighboring table who then came over to talk. There were laughs and it was a great social time. When they left, my husband said 'how long has it been since we sent the steak back'....we looked and 'oh my' doesn't begin to cut it. The manager was flagged down and informed us the hamburger steak was burned AGAIN and another manager was in the back teaching the cooks how to prepare a proper hamburger steak. Needless to say - we had been there for more than 2 hours at this point. I wouldn't eat without my husband receiving his order. By the time he received a properly cooked hamburger steak, he was so disgusted we took everything home in to-go boxes. I will commend our waitress for her amazing customer service skills. She kept us in rolls, drinks, and was constantly asking what she could do for us. Just a gem in an otherwise negative dining experience. The manager definately took care of us. I will say that in spite of not receiving the order correctly OR the time we took to receive the proper order, she went above and beyond. Think about it......knowing these cooks are subpar could be ignored. Instead - this manager took the time to TEACH her employees and not to pass the buck. She didn't let this lack of doing their job properly be ignored. The cooks were INSTRUCTED with another manager standing behind them making sure they cooked the hamburger steak correctly. How impressive is that?? While this is just one example in a string of visits where something on our order was undercooked or overcooked, I will say it gave me a new respect for the manager that is currently trying to shape things up at her restaurant! Our waitresss - we couldn't have been more impressed!!",Monday,"['this', 'texas', 'roadhouse', 'sits', 'high', 'on', 'a', 'hill', 'in', 'roanoke', 'with', 'a', 'winding', 'and', 'gear', 'churning',

We have all worked in restaurants and I still do so we are very patient and understanding but I have never had such a terrible experience in my life. Our server greeted us in a timely manner we order a prime rib, ribery, and steak salad as well as a chicken breast entree. My cousin and I had ordered drinks as well, the salads came out before the meal but still no drinks I kindly reminded our server, no big deal just in case she forgot. She brought them back the margarita was completely watered down with water floating on top, it had been sitting there, still we didnt say anything we just didnt drink it. Then the prime rib and chicken dinner came out but the other two plates didnt, which is odd because realisticly chicken should take longer than rare steaks to come out, she said it would be 3 minutes on the other plates. We waited to eat since my boyfriend and cousin still had no plates, 20 minutes later the manager brings out my boyfriends steak without the side and drops off the salads. Both steaks were overcooked he never asked us how anything was, and never apologized for our now cold food. Our original server never returned to the table instead we had another server return to the table to give us our check. We never got asked how our meals were, If everything was cooked properly ect. Being in the industry myself, I of course still tipped (everyone has bad day) but I can say I wouldve never neglected my tables that way, this goes for the server, and the manager that brought the food out. All food should have been brought to the table at the same time.

2019-07-06,Logan's Roadhouse,1.0,Milton A,"It's been a couple of days since I took my family of 7 to Logans in Roanoke to eat. We wanted to enjoy a nice meal together before the 4th of July activities began. Wanting to beat the crowd, we arrived at 11:30 AM. The appetizers of onion petals and fried bacon were good and the rolls were fine, however, the issues began once the main courses arrived. My wife's steak that she ordered medium rare arrived WELL done. My steak that I ordered medium arrived WELL done and my son's steak on his sausage and steak platter which he ordered medium also arrived WELL done. My son and I ate all of ours that we could, however, my wife asked that her's be sent back and prepared the way she prefers it. While she waited (the rest of us began eating) she decided to eat her side dishes of broccoli and rice. By the time her new steak arrived she had finished her sides. A gentleman delivered her new steak (we assumed he was a manger but he never identified himself) and she said to him, ""The broccoli and rice were excellent but would have been better with the steak"" to which he replied, ""I bet he would have been"" and walked off. No apology for the incorrect steak(s) and no offer to bring fresh sides due to the kitchen error. After spending $134.00 for 7 people to eat, a person would expect a little more from a manager.

2019-03-12,TGI Fridays,1.0,jewels1420,"We called a week in advance to TGI Fridays's in Roanoke Virginia to alert the restaurant that there was a huge wrestling tournament in town, and many people would choose their restaurant for lunch Friday afternoon around 2, come all at once, and need to be out by 3:30 or 4. Told that they had no separate party room, they promised to hold tables together if they could for 20-30 people. We didn't care so much about sitting together as to make sure there were enough servers for our group. We called again the day before the planned event and again reminded the manager that we would be coming all at once around 2. When we arrived at 2:15 the manager said she was just about to leave, but had staff available. (The weather was bad, so the bar staff was short). She then proceeded to try to serve the entire group by herself! Our people went to the bar for their own drinks several times. She took orders for the entire group one table at a time but didn't take any orders back, so the kitchen got orders for 10 tables all at once! Needless to say, it was quite a wait. I was disappointed in the service, although the food was satisfactory once it finally arrived. The manager needed to have help available, ask for help if it was available and be more efficient for her kitchen staff who stood around and waited for orders and then received them all at once!",Tuesday,"['we', 'called', 'a', 'week', 'in', 'advance', 'to', 'tgi', ""fridays's"", 'in', 'roanoke', 'virginia', 'to', 'alert', 'the', 'restaurant', 'that', 'there', 'was', 'a', 'huge', 'wrestling', 'tournament', 'in', 'town', 'and', 'many', 'people', 'would', 'choose', 'their', 'restaurant', 'for', 'lunch', 'friday', 'afternoon', 'around', '2', 'come', 'all', 'at', 'once', 'and', 'need', 'to', 'be', 'out', 'by', '3:30', 'or', '4', 'told', 'that', 'they', 'had', 'no', 'separate', 'party', 'room', 'they', 'promised', 'to', 'hold', 'tables', 'together', 'if', 'they', 'could', 'for', '20-30', 'people', 'we', ""didn't"", 'care', 'so', 'much', 'about', 'sitting', 'together', 'as', 'to', 'make', 'sure', 'there', 'were', 'enough', 'servers', 'for', 'our', 'group', 'we', 'called', 'again', 'the', 'day', 'before', 'the', 'planned', 'event', 'and', 'again', 'reminded', 'the', 'manager', 'that', 'we', 'would', 'be', 'coming', 'all', 'at', 'once', 'around', '2', 'when', 'we', 'arrived', 'at', '2:15', 'the', 'manager', 'said', 'she', 'was', 'just', 'about', 'to', 'leave', 'but', 'had', 'staff', 'available', 'the', 'weather', 'was', 'bad', 'so', 'the', 'bar', 'staff', 'was', 'short', 'she', 'then', 'proceeded', 'to', 'try', 'to', 'serve', 'the', 'entire', 'group', 'by', 'herself', 'our', 'people', 'went', 'to', 'the', 'bar', 'for', 'their', 'own', 'drinks', 'several', 'times', 'she', 'took', 'orders', 'for', 'the', 'entire', 'group', 'one', 'table', 'at', 'a', 'time', 'but', ""didn't"", 'take', 'any', 'orders', 'back', 'so', 'the', 'kitchen', 'got', 'orders', 'for', '10', 'tables', 'all', 'at', 'once', 'needless', 'to', 'say', 'it', 'was', 'quite', 'a', 'wait', 'i', 'was', 'disappointed', 'in', 'the', 'service', 'although', 'the', 'food', 'was', 'satisfactory', 'once', 'it', 'finally', 'arrived', 'the', 'manager', 'needed', 'to', 'have', 'help', 'available', 'ask', 'for', 'help', 'if', 'it', 'was', 'available', 'and', 'be', 'more', 'efficient', 'for', 'her', 'kitchen', 'staff', 'who', 'stood', 'around', 'and', 'waited', 'for', 'orders', 'and', 'then', 'received', 'them', 'all', 'at', 'once']",254,0.023622047244094488,0.015748031496062992,Positive,Yes

The big screen TV was in disrepair, it had a yellow glow to it, very distracting to watch. I observed some dishes coming out and they did not look very appetizing, but to be fair I've had some meals that were great that didn't look real good, just not very often. The menu pages were stuck together, like they hadn't been cleaned recently. Decided to get food elsewhere. After waiting 10 minutes to get my bill for the one beer I had, $7.

2019-09-02,Jersey Lily's Roadhouse Grill,3.0,Gayleetro,We go to Jersey Lily's on a regular basis because it's close to home. My go to dish is the Steak Salad. The salad is always fresh and the small steak is cooked to order and just the right amount of steak for a salad.

My dad and I came to town and met my brother and his wife, his son and wife and baby and my uncle and his wife. This was the first time my dad met his great grandson. It was a busy Friday night but they gave us this huge table in its own little room which was nice. Also, it was a round table so you could see and talk to everyone. My uncle said he has been coming here for about ten years and always gets great food and service. I believe him! Our server was very sweet and attentive. She was always there when we needed something and she got all of our ordered correct. Im a vegetarian, so I was impressed by all the veggie options they offer. In most steak houses I can get a baked potato and a salad and thats it. This place gave me those and other options. I ordered Mac and cheese, French fries and a salad. It was so good. Everyone else really loved their food too. The server even took our picture for us. It was great! There plenty of room outside the building that we could take lots of pics.

The meat was tender ( a little peppery), potatoes tasted fresh, flavorful gravy, and seasoned green beans. Hubby got the seafood platter which was a crab cake, about a dozen fried shrimp, and two nice sized pieces of cod. First, a disclaimer - we're from MD so we know what a good crab cake is SUPPOSED to taste like, and this wasn't it! Entirely too much filler, to the point he couldn't finish eating it, and my taste of it concurred. The cod was super breaded, so much so that hubby had to scrape some off. He said the shrimp were good. His meal was to come with fries and slaw. Fries were hot and crispy. Slaw was missing from his plate!

We opted to sit in the bar area since it was a Saturday afternoon and college football was on almost all of the TVs. (They are all around the restaurant). The bartender came & greeted us. We asked for waters until we could decide what we wanted to order. After about 10 minutes my husband went to the hostess & asked if one of the waitstaff could come to our table which they did almost immediately. She took our drink orders and in the meantime the bartender came with our waters. She apologized and said she had gotten busy at the bar. Our new server was excellent and attentive. We ordered a flatbread and it was enough for the two of us and very tasty. Our second visit was at night & once again we sat in the bar area. Same story...we had to hunt down a waitperson.

While I waited in this sports bar atmosphere with big screen TVs, I ordered a neat Makers Mark. I received my drink quickly. It took approximately 20 minutes for my tater tots to arrive. The portion was small to average. My first taste of the tots, I immediately tasted an odd flavor. I tried another and still the taste was gross. I had my boss with me and she also acknowledged that the tots tasted rancid. I told the manager and they sent them back and order me another batch. After waiting another 30 minutes we received another new batch of tater tots. Again when I tasted them, they tasted awful. The manager came to see if I liked them and I told them no...i asked what rule of cheese they used and they said a homemade cheese....that was the problem. I left the tater tots after only eating two tots on the table. I was still billed for the tater tots. I paid it and I warn you from this establishment.

A wonderful selection of tacos to choose from or build your own. Our party had The Hillbilly, The Texan, Portabello, Black Bean and the Pork Carnitas.

The ingredients were very fresh and unique to each taco and the flavor was outstanding.

They all have cucumber, pickled carrots and radishes, cilantro, chicken liver pate, and jalapenos. Then you can choose from ham, grilled chicken, pork, a combination and a few others. They will often ask children if they would prefer no jalapenos. They also have a small or large bowl of pho, a noodle bowl with your choice of meat, and a saladk with the same fixings as the sandwhiches.

It was really big and very good. Fresh lime and basil (I think, on the side). I had the Roasted Chicken sub. Excellent fresh banquette, Yummy real chicken pieces that seemed to be from a roasted chicken. Loved the ingredients on the sub. Dont be scared away by the chicken liver pate the menu says is on their subs. I either didnt taste it or it added a good taste to the sub. I did not get the jalapeo peppers, but something on my sub gave it a burning hot taste. Still a great sandwich. Next time I will ask them what makes it so spicy hot and will ask that not to be included. Just providing a heads up in case hot spice is mot your thing. My friend had the meatball sub. Hes a particular eater (doesnt enjoy trying new things) and it wasnt what he expected. Was thinking something with red sauce. I didnt taste it so I cant tell u anything about it other than it was their standard meatball sub with all the standard fixings.

2019-09-21,Leonore Restaurant,3.0,RoverP,"What an odd place. Walked in and the place was deserted. There was nobody behind the take away counter so I walked through a short side corridor into what was the main dining area. This was quite spacious but only 2 tables were occupied and no staff to be seen. Went back to the takeaway area and someone appeared and we were shown a table. The dining room was pretty bleak with exposed air conditioning pipes and no effort having been made to make the room welcoming. We ordered drinks whilst looking at the menu. My wifes cola arrived together with water for me but not the beer I had ordered. When the waiter came back there was still no beer but he wanted to take our food order. He said someone was just getting the beer. I mean, it was not as if they were busy!The beer eventually arrived. The food arrived but with no attempt to present it attractively. However, contrary to expectations the food was actually very good. Apart from the man who showed us to the table, there were 3 waiters and yet the way they were behaving you would have thought there were 54 tables in use instead of a maximum of 4. Its a shame.

2019-05-13,Leonore Restaurant,2.0,Lee S,"Our visit was an evening before Mothers Day dinner. The restaurant was nicely situated and near paid parking. The house was about half-full and appeared to be primarily family staffed with a fair number of regulars. Our meal took a solid hour to arrive with only one check-in from our waiter about a half hour in. It took twenty minutes to get refills on our drinks. Ten minutes after that, our food arrived. What was really surprising was that staff seemed totally oblivious to the divide apparent between the regulars who must expect this pacing and those of us at several tables who were clearly irritated to angry at the service level. I gather that this means our experience was the typical one. My meatball dish was overcooked to nearly burnt, but it still had decent flavor. The pizza my little one ordered was tasty. The other pasta dishes ordered by those at the table got average reviews. If the service was better or the food was better, I might go back. As it is, I doubt I would return.

2019-10-14,Garden Song Eco Cafe,5.0,Katy C,"My husband and I have been wanting to try this Cafe, but initially they were only open Mon-Friday daytime, when we are both at work. However, we took today off and went for lunch. We split a Zen Garden Panini and a southwestn quinoa bowl. Both items were delish! The Panani was on a wonderful grainy local sourdough bread and the amish cheese melted beautifully. The quinoa bowl was perfectly seasoned and proportioned. We grabbed a chai muffin to split later, after hearing another customer order one, eat it while paying and then promptly order a second. Yes they are that good.It appears they have not only extended their hours, now open evenings and weekends, but also have an ABC license and a nice selection of beer, wine, hard kombucha and more. We are already talking about coming back for dinner soon. Note: the quinoa bowls are only served until 3:00 pm. Not sure why that is, but there are plenty of other, healthy options on the menu that you can order for dinner.

The place the dog stand was, was now a window. I thought I was losing my mind. I stumbled around and found it when I backed up. Once there, I noticed it was larger and gone was the whit marble counter with the crack in it. I asked when they moved, and the young lady at the counter said with little feeling, 6 years ago. If anything, her attitude and her he absence of the white marble reduces the charm of the experience. So for about $2, you get a good dog with a unique taste. Its not the best, its above average, but theres a loss in status because its no longer the same. One can spend years dishing it out, and the practice becomes familiar, welcome and comfortable. Changing the location interrupts this charm. Im glad one can still get a legendary dog, but its just not the same. My rating is based on my overall history with the stand.

2019-09-16,Agave Azul Mexican Grill & Bar,3.0,John B,"I have the occasion to dine at the Agave Azul during a business trip northeast of Roanoke. I was staying in a Hotel next door to this restaurant with no other dining options available without driving a few miles. The hotel manager suggested I try it, and he thought the food there was good. I took his advise, since I had been driving all day and did not feel like having be back in the car for a quick dinner. The Agave Azul has an attractive building with plenty of parking. I found the interior atmosphere to be very pleasant having a clean and appropriate western look and decore. The staff was also very pleasant and the service was surprisingly fast. The menu selections were varied and consistant with items one would expect from a quality offering of Mexican fare. The pricing was slightly higher than mid-point, but not unreasonable. Unfortunately, this is where my acclaim for this establishment has to end. I would sum up this way:1. Convenient Location.2. NIce Atmosphere3. Great Staff with Fast Service.4. Mediocre Food. I guess you could say that three out of four isn't bad, except that good food is why we eat. I ordered a popular dish, that was supposed to be a specialty. I thought it must have taken special effort to cook all of the flavor out of the entre before serving it. The side items were fine. Personally I prefer to eat in a hole-in the wall dive with great food, rather than a nice restaurant with ""just OK"" meals.So, if you find yourself staying next door the Agave Azul, and just want some chips and a beer, by all means eat here. However, if you are in the mood for a really good meal, take your car for a drive to another location.",Monday,"['i', 'have', 'the', 'occasion', 'to', 'dine', 'at', 'the', 'agave', 'azul', 'during', 'a', 'business', 'trip', 'northeast', 'of', 'roanoke', 'i', 'was', 'staying', 'in', 'a', 'hotel', 'next', 'door', 'to', 'this', 'restaurant', 'with', 'no', 'other', 'dining', 'options', 'available', 'without', 'driving', 'a', 'few', 'miles', 'the', 'hotel', 'manager', 'suggested', 'i', 'try', 'it', 'and', 'he', 'thought', 'the', 'food', 'there', 'was', 'good', 'i', 'took', 'his', 'advise', 'since', 'i', 'had', 'been', 'driving', 'all', 'day', 'and', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'like', 'having', 'be', 'back', 'in', 'the', 'car', 'for', 'a', 'quick', 'dinner', 'the', 'agave', 'azul', 'has', 'an', 'attractive', 'building', 'with', 'plenty', 'of', 'parking', 'i', 'found', 'the', 'interior', 'atmosphere', 'to', 'be', 'very', 'pleasant', 'having', 'a', 'clean', 'and', 'appropriate', 'western', 'look', 'and', 'decore', 'the', 'staff', 'was', 'also', 'very', 'pleasant', 'and', 'the', 'service', 'was', 'surprisingly', 'fast', 'the', 'menu', 'selections', 'were', 'varied', 'and', 'consistant', 'with', 'items', 'one', 'would', 'expect', 'from', 'a', 'quality', 'offering', 'of', 'mexican', 'fare', 'the', 'pricing', 'was', 'slightly', 'higher', 'than', 'mid-point', 'but', 'not', 'unreasonable', 'unfortunately', 'this', 'is', 'where', 'my', 'acclaim', 'for', 'this', 'establishment', 'has', 'to', 'end', 'i', 'would', 'sum', 'up', 'this', 'way:1', 'convenient', 'location.2', 'nice', 'atmosphere3', 'great', 'staff', 'with', 'fast', 'service.4', 'mediocre', 'food', 'i', 'guess', 'you', 'could', 'say', 'that', 'three', 'out', 'of', 'four', ""isn't"", 'bad', 'except', 'that', 'good', 'food', 'is', 'why', 'we', 'eat', 'i', 'ordered', 'a', 'popular', 'dish', 'that', 'was', 'supposed', 'to', 'be', 'a', 'specialty', 'i', 'thought', 'it', 'must', 'have', 'taken', 'special', 'effort', 'to', 'cook', 'all', 'of', 'the', 'flavor', 'out', 'of', 'the', 'entre', 'before', 'serving', 'it', 'the', 'side', 'items', 'were', 'fine', 'personally', 'i', 'prefer', 'to', 'eat', 'in', 'a', 'hole-in', 'the', 'wall', 'dive', 'with', 'great', 'food', 'rather', 'than', 'a', 'nice', 'restaurant', 'with', 'just', 'ok', 'meals.so', 'if', 'you', 'find', 'yourself', 'staying', 'next', 'door', 'the', 'agave', 'azul', 'and', 'just', 'want', 'some', 'chips', 'and', 'a', 'beer', 'by', 'all', 'means', 'eat', 'here', 'however', 'if', 'you', 'are', 'in', 'the', 'mood', 'for', 'a', 'really', 'good', 'meal', 'take', 'your', 'car', 'for', 'a', 'drive', 'to', 'another', 'location']",304,0.06578947368421052,0.013157894736842105,Positive,Yes

We ordered breakfast and I asked her to make sure my bacon was crisp (i hate under cooked bacon!).Then the wait begin. With no more customers than there were (by that time there was only one other table), I figured the service would be as quick as it usually is. But not this time. It took approximately 15 minutes for our food to arrive and this was just eggs and bacon and pancakes! My bacon was crisp but that was about the only thing they got right. Our ""over medium"" eggs were not and the pancakes were so cold the butter wouldn't melt. I got the impression the they had been sitting back in the kitchen waiting to be picked up. I sent the pancakes back to be heated up and went ahead and are my runny eggs. When we got the check if was $25, which I thought was a little high, but I have the girl 2 twenties.

2019-07-16,The River and Rail,5.0,Filmprof,"We had dinner here on a Wednesday night and virtually every table was occupied. That speaks to the quality of The River and Rail. It was a great experience from beginning to end, from being greeted by GM Aaron as we were seated to the warm goodbyes as we left. The room is cleanly designed and inviting. And the food is outstanding -- fresh ingredients, imaginatively prepared. The pickles (cucumbers, mushrooms, carrots, celery, etc.) are a nice way to wake up your palate. The chicken liver mouse was silky and rich. I adored my catfish. It was light and crispy and the prep did not overwhelm the flavor of the fish. The rice grits and collards were a perfect accompaniment. That may sound like a sort of typical ""southern"" dish, but everything was elevated. A scallops special was a winner as were the savory pork ribs. My only quibble was that the side of beets with dill and yogurt sauce might have been better at room temperature rather than warm. We were going to skip dessert, but were happy we didn't. A chocolate pots de creme type of thing and a semolina cake with berries were both delicious. Drinks and wine were top-of-the line.I can't say enough about the service. The staff moved as if they had been choreographed, especially when it can to the delivery of the dishes. Our server (wish that I could recall her name) could not have been better. She was friendly but not ""familiar"", attentive but never hovering, and had an answer for every question -- everything you could hope for in a server.This was one of the most satisfying dining experiences I've had in the past year.

2018-02-16,Cafe Jano,3.0,PriusGirlVA,"We were driving cross country and stopped in Roanoke for dinner on a Friday night. Checked out some online reviews and Caf Jano seemed very well liked by most people. We love Mediterranean food so thought we would give it a try.The dcor looks like a fast food restaurant. Not fast food like McDonald's, but in the same league as Chipotle. The tables were clean and the temperature of the place was good (it was cold outside). There were 3 other tables taken when we arrived, and it didn't take long to notice that there was only ONE EMPLOYEE WORKING. On a Friday night. It appeared to be the owner. He was functioning as waiter, chef, owner, and bus boy. Alone. All the while wearing what seemed to be the same pair of blue latex gloves... I felt bad for the man - juggling all the work alone is crazy. He was out of some things - French fries and kibbi as an appetizer. He took our order promptly enough, but that is when the loooong wait began. Everything is prepared fresh, which is fantastic and I expect that to take a while (I think the menu even noted to expect to wait about 15 minutes for food). But when it was well over half an hour and our small order - a salad and one shwarma - had not yet arrived, well, we almost bailed and left. But I felt bad knowing the poor man was probably back in the kitchen trying to prep our dinners...When the food finally came it was very tasty. The meat especially was very well marinated and delicious. It did seem over priced for what we got, but by the time it got to our table we snarfed it up because we were starving. Another table of people arrived while we were there, so the chef/owner/bus boy/waiter never got a chance to rest at all. Nor did he really get a chance to do re-fills on drinks or ask if anyone wanted dessert or anything else.Recommendation: keep the same good food, hire 2 or 3 servers.",Friday,"['we', 'were', 'driving', 'cross', 'country', 'and', 'stopped', 'in', 'roanoke', 'for', 'dinner', 'on', 'a', 'friday', 'night', 'checked', 'out', 'some', 'online', 'reviews', 'and', 'caf', 'jano', 'seemed', 'very', 'well', 'liked', 'by', 'most', 'people', 'we', 'love', 'mediterranean', 'food', 'so', 'thought', 'we', 'would', 'give', 'it', 'a', 'try.the', 'dcor', 'looks', 'like', 'a', 'fast', 'food', 'restaurant', 'not', 'fast', 'food', 'like', ""mcdonald's"", 'but', 'in', 'the', 'same', 'league', 'as', 'chipotle', 'the', 'tables', 'were', 'clean', 'and', 'the', 'temperature', 'of', 'the', 'place', 'was', 'good', 'it', 'was', 'cold', 'outside', 'there', 'were', '3', 'other', 'tables', 'taken', 'when', 'we', 'arrived', 'and', 'it', ""didn't"", 'take', 'long', 'to', 'notice', 'that', 'there', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'employee', 'working', 'on', 'a', 'friday', 'night', 'it', 'appeared', 'to', 'be', 'the', 'owner', 'he', 'was', 'functioning', 'as', 'waiter', 'chef', 'owner', 'and', 'bus', 'boy', 'alone', 'all', 'the', 'while', 'wearing', 'what', 'seemed', 'to', 'be', 'the', 'same', 'pair', 'of', 'blue', 'latex', 'gloves', 'i', 'felt', 'bad', 'for', 'the', 'man', '', 'juggling', 'all', 'the', 'work', 'alone', 'is', 'crazy', 'he', 'was', 'out', 'of', 'some', 'things', '', 'french', 'fries', 'and', 'kibbi', 'as', 'an', 'appetizer', 'he', 'took', 'our', 'order', 'promptly', 'enough', 'but', 'that', 'is', 'when', 'the', 'loooong', 'wait', 'began', 'everything', 'is', 'prepared', 'fresh', 'which', 'is', 'fantastic', 'and', 'i', 'expect', 'that', 'to', 'take', 'a', 'while', 'i', 'think', 'the', 'menu', 'even', 'noted', 'to', 'expect', 'to', 'wait', 'about', '15', 'minutes', 'for', 'food', 'but', 'when', 'it', 'was', 'well', 'over', 'half', 'an', 'hour', 'and', 'our', 'small', 'order', '', 'a', 'salad', 'and', 'one', 'shwarma', '', 'had', 'not', 'yet', 'arrived', 'well', 'we', 'almost', 'bailed', 'and', 'left', 'but', 'i', 'felt', 'bad', 'knowing', 'the', 'poor', 'man', 'was', 'probably', 'back', 'in', 'the', 'kitchen', 'trying', 'to', 'prep', 'our', 'dinners...when', 'the', 'food', 'finally', 'came', 'it', 'was', 'very', 'tasty', 'the', 'meat', 'especially', 'was', 'very', 'well', 'marinated', 'and', 'delicious', 'it', 'did', 'seem', 'over', 'priced', 'for', 'what', 'we', 'got', 'but', 'by', 'the', 'time', 'it', 'got', 'to', 'our', 'table', 'we', 'snarfed', 'it', 'up', 'because', 'we', 'were', 'starving', 'another', 'table', 'of', 'people', 'arrived', 'while', 'we', 'were', 'there', 'so', 'the', 'chef/owner/bus', 'boy/waiter', 'never', 'got', 'a', 'chance', 'to', 'rest', 'at', 'all', 'nor', 'did', 'he', 'really', 'get', 'a', 'chance', 'to', 'do', 're-fills', 'on', 'drinks', 'or', 'ask', 'if', 'anyone', 'wanted', 'dessert', 'or', 'anything', 'else.recommendation', 'keep', 'the', 'same', 'good', 'food', 'hire', '2', 'or', '3', 'servers']",352,0.04261363636363636,0.019886363636363636,Positive,Yes

2016-11-25,Cafe Jano,3.0,Tblass24,"I visited Caf Jano last week for the first time. The dining area was very clean and tidy. There were 3 occupied tables on my lunch visit, but that may have been because I took a later lunch (1:15 pm) than usual. They offer Mediterranean and American fare from an uncomplicated menu. Items such as Gyros, Souvlaki, Kabobs, Falafel, Burgers, Submarines, Greek Salads, Grape Leaves, Kibbi, Baba Ghanouj, etc. I tried the Beef & Lamb Gyro ($8.50) as well as my dining partner. It comes with chips, but I opted for the French Fries for an additional $1.95. We found the Gyro to be tasty and both remarked that it could have used a little more meat for the price. The chef was a little heavy handed with the tzatziki sauce. The onions were of a large dice and I had to remove some to manage the strong flavor. I shared this with the waitress who said she would inform the chef to dice the onions into smaller pieces. The fries were delicious and appeared to be hand cut. The service was fine but would note that the chef and waitress appeared to be the only two employees working. The chef actually came from the kitchen to bus a couple of tables and to ask if we enjoyed our meal. I will definitely go back and try some different offerings from the menu.",Friday,"['i', 'visited', 'caf', 'jano', 'last', 'week', 'for', 'the', 'first', 'time', 'the', 'dining', 'area', 'was', 'very', 'clean', 'and', 'tidy', 'there', 'were', '3', 'occupied', 'tables', 'on', 'my', 'lunch', 'visit', 'but', 'that', 'may', 'have', 'been', 'because', 'i', 'took', 'a', 'later', 'lunch', '1:15', 'pm', 'than', 'usual', 'they', 'offer', 'mediterranean', 'and', 'american', 'fare', 'from', 'an', 'uncomplicated', 'menu', 'items', 'such', 'as', 'gyros', 'souvlaki', 'kabobs', 'falafel', 'burgers', 'submarines', 'greek', 'salads', 'grape', 'leaves', 'kibbi', 'baba', 'ghanouj', 'etc', 'i', 'tried', 'the', 'beef', '', 'lamb', 'gyro', '8.50', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'my', 'dining', 'partner', 'it', 'comes', 'with', 'chips', 'but', 'i', 'opted', 'for', 'the', 'french', 'fries', 'for', 'an', 'additional', '1.95', 'we', 'found', 'the', 'gyro', 'to', 'be', 'tasty', 'and', 'both', 'remarked', 'that', 'it', 'could', 'have', 'used', 'a', 'little', 'more', 'meat', 'for', 'the', 'price', 'the', 'chef', 'was', 'a', 'little', 'heavy', 'handed', 'with', 'the', 'tzatziki', 'sauce', 'the', 'onions', 'were', 'of', 'a', 'large', 'dice', 'and', 'i', 'had', 'to', 'remove', 'some', 'to', 'manage', 'the', 'strong', 'flavor', 'i', 'shared', 'this', 'with', 'the', 'waitress', 'who', 'said', 'she', 'would', 'inform', 'the', 'chef', 'to', 'dice', 'the', 'onions', 'into', 'smaller', 'pieces', 'the', 'fries', 'were', 'delicious', 'and', 'appeared', 'to', 'be', 'hand', 'cut', 'the', 'service', 'was', 'fine', 'but', 'would', 'note', 'that', 'the', 'chef', 'and', 'waitress', 'appeared', 'to', 'be', 'the', 'only', 'two', 'employees', 'working', 'the', 'chef', 'actually', 'came', 'from', 'the', 'kitchen', 'to', 'bus', 'a', 'couple', 'of', 'tables', 'and', 'to', 'ask', 'if', 'we', 'enjoyed', 'our', 'meal', 'i', 'will', 'definitely', 'go', 'back', 'and', 'try', 'some', 'different', 'offerings', 'from', 'the', 'menu']",233,0.034334763948497854,0.008583690987124463,Positive,Yes

I ordered the Petra platter, a delicious vegetarian sampler consisting of stuffed grape leaves, crispy falafels, creamy hummus, smoky baba, tabouleh, and tzatziki. The platter was drizzled with olive oil and lightly accented with a delicious condiment made in house that I would liken to a tangy salsa. It was a generous portion and I appreciated that the plate and flat ware were real and not disposable. I appreciate being able to sample lots of items, and six items for $10.95 was well worth it.My husband ordered the kufta sandwich that came griddled and wrapped in foil.

2018-04-28,Petra Mediterranean Grill,4.0,Michael B,"My wife and I had dinner here while passing thru the Cave Spring area. It is a small place in a new building and an Indian grocery store is next door. The menu is not extensive but has the usual items for Middle Eastern cuisine. Two soups were offered, a lentil and another that we both ordered called Freekah. Neither of us had had it before and were curious. We also ordered the appetizer sampler to split and two Gyros. The soup came first and was piping hot, the way I like soup. I think this soup is an acquired taste. My wife really liked it; I wouldn't order it again. But the appetizer sampler! Wow, enough for 6 people! We decided to have that for dinner and had them pack our Gyros to take home, lunch the next day. Anyway, the baba ghanouj was delicious, as was the hummus, yogurt, falafel, etc. Even the tabbouleh was great, and I'm picky about that item, but this was very flavorful, and not overwhelmed with parsley taste. The pita was warm and soft and cut in small pieces, perfect. I would definitely return to this place.

2018-04-08,Petra Mediterranean Grill,3.0,T9136ZEtonyp,"This has taken over the space previously occupied by Indika Caf on Brambleton. Pretty much the same setup without the pitchers of water on the tables. I was excited to try this place for the first time but leave with mixed feelings. First, my samosa were quite cold in the middle. Very disappointing. The gyro was ok. Not the best I have ever had. It was made like a wrap instead of the traditional pita. The meat was too uniformly sliced and shaped for me to believe it came off a rotisserie. It makes me question if they were even made on site or pre made and packaged elsewhere and simple heated up to serve. While it wasn't terrible, it definitely did not have the freshness or texture of a well made gyro. The girl at the counter insisted on pronouncing gyro as ""JyeRoh"" which was a small irritant. It was a little pricey for a place you order at a counter. $15.17 for the gyro combo with fried and bottled drink and the order of samosa. Perhaps their entrees like the kabobs are better?

2019-07-23,The Great 611 Steak Company,1.0,CharlieLikesToTravel,"Either these reviewers know nothing of a good meal or we just came on a very bad night! Know your menu... first thing in the restaurant business. Second, dont use instant crap because people with a half decent pallet will know. My daughter orders wings and expressly says make them extra crispy. They were breaded and soggy with an excuse that you cant make breaded wings crispy. Well, tell us theyre breaded because the menu doesnt say that. I order an 8oz fillet mignon powder keg. My wife wants the same but not with the seasoning of a powder keg. The waitress tells her shell get the same without the seasoning. She was served a cheaply cut thin sirloin filet. Definitely not what the waitress described. Again, know your menu. My powder keg steak came out beautiful and the one bite I did get was awesome. But since its our daughters birthday and her wings were crap I gave her my steak and waited on a replacement that never came. A steak that literally takes 5 minutes to cook never came within twenty five minutes before I said screw it. Let me not forget to mention the side of mushrooms. I told the waitress when I ordered to please get me a side of sautd mushrooms. My steak arrived with some kind of mushroom gravy that you would poke over your dogs food. I originally wanted mashed potatoes but the waitress did warn me they were instant so I went with the baked. They bring you a baked potato that you are required to then take to a potato bar across the restaurant to dress. I guess they cant be bothered to bring you a loaded bake potato like every steakhouse in the country does. By time you get back your damned dinner is cold. Great thinking there...The potato bar: made up of fake bacon bits, and some hard as rock sour cream you have to use the cutting knife to dip from the huge container on the bar. I also told them it was our daughters birthday. They brought the crappy frozen piece of cake out before our dinner was even served so the choice was stare are the cake and wait until after dinner or ruin dinner by eating it. It wasnt edible anyway so the choice was easy.

We should come here more often, because it's a comfortable place with a dependable menu and service. And if you're celebrating an anniversary and give them a reservation with 24 hours' notice, they give you a complimentary baked Alaska. Our server was good and professional. He was prompt and served us efficiently. He might have been a little overextended -- it was very busy -- and I am dinging him a little for not splitting our tab (an anniversary habit: I pay my wife's and she pays mine) and for being too slow with it. But no big matter. My wife's martini was very big and very dry and only $6 for a call brand. I drank San Pellegrino; it was $7. We both had tossed salads, both with blue cheese dressing. The salads were fresh and lightly chilled (not too cold) and toppings are served at the table. Our entrees were the Coach & 4 Special (broiled shrimp, scallops and chicken breast over rice), which my wife complimented, and the ""Grande New York Strip,"" 14 oz., medium rare, which was very tender with a nice strip of fat down its length, and done as requested. A memorable meal? For us, yes, because it's what we always have. And that's both a plus and a minus: Except for posted specials, the menu has gone largely unchanged for decades.

Prices kept pricey considering the atmosphere and inside table area is more like a dive place than a lovely restaurant atmosphere that warrants prices to match. Service was good and friendly but it was on the more dingy sparse side and the bathrooms are located oddly outside doors down in somewhat of a in my opinion not so nice food courtyard area of common other.... but when paying menu prices like Wall Street has , i expect different . And the street area oddly very historic and potentially pretty but reminded more like streets in New York City but much quieter , much less busy, without the crowds and hustle and bustle but the town struck me as i didnt feel as safe as I would in a town like Alexandria va for instance. Lovely historic town but oddly prices dont seem to match with atmosphere, and surroundings and reminded me more of a dive like bar and restaurant than an establishment for a pricier menu .

Its obvious in how the treat you, welcome you and say hello and good-bye. Separate large dining room to left of where you order. Lots of booths seating 4 and a big table to sit 6/8. They will ask if you are eating in or to go. They bring food to your table on paper plate if you are eating in. We did see one table with food served in to-go plastic containers. Perhaps, they asked for that. Hot tea is available in the dining room for no extra charge. Coke products in cans, individual bottles and 2 liter bottles can be purchased. Food is plentiful and fresh and not overcooked. We had enough to have lunch tomorrow. I had shrimp with fresh vegetables. All delicious and not over-cooked. I like my veggies a tad bit harder so next time I will ask them to cook a little less time. But all veggies I got were bright in color, fresh, solid (vs limp) and not overcooked. 5/6 good size shrimp cooked just right with great flavor. Great amount for the pint size order at $5.75. Not a fancy place-but clean. Clean large restroom too. Bus your own throwaways to the garbage can near the ordering counter. They are quick to wipe table down after you leave-so clean tables when you sit down. We will be back. I want to try their wings. The best wings I have ever had are at another local Chinese restaurant. Have to see how they compare. Didnt see egg foo yung nor moo shu pork/chicken on the menu. Give them a try.

And I myself was a gourmet Chinese cook in my younger years. I was taught by Chinese chefs. We ordered at counter to dine in. Served on real dinnerware with real silverware. Very clean restaurant and not a lot of ""stuff"" all over. Clean booths and tables. Lots of ppl with orders to go and several dine-ins. Extremely generous portions. Presentation of food is important to the owners. I ordered shrimp egg foo young. They were gigantic....3 of them. And crispy on the outside! Plenty of fried rice served in a soup bowl. I liked that they served the sauce in a separate bowl so I could control the amount and not have the dish overwhelmed with soy-tasting sauce. Nice size shrimp, not those rinky-dink ones. My friend had chicken chow mein. Generous amounts of white chicken; not overloaded with cabbage like most places. And not swimming in white sauce....just enough. Huge bowl of white rice. Also had bowl of egg drop soup served with bowl of sectioned deep-fried wonton wrappers. All of this for less than $16, including tax. Definitely this will be our Chinese (they have some Thai) restaurant going forward. Worth the 1/2 hr drive.

My girlfriend had the Kale Salad and she couldnt eat but a small amount. I had Sauteed Kale with my cedar plank salmon and seasoned Quinoa. I could not chew my Kale and the Quinoa was not bad but very little seasoning. Some would probably like it. Salmon, I should have had them cook it for me a little more. Outsides were to my preference, medium rare but the closer to the middle, it became rare. But, it wasn not too bad. Unfortunately the bathrooms male and female were not pleasant. Not exactly what you want after a dining experience, whether good or bad. I think they had a bad day. Normally I hear good things about this place. Two other times I dined, it was good.

Thailand? I'm not eating it. The staff is great, I wonder if they are ashamed of the dishes they place before customers? They ought to be. I have travelled very widely and know what good seafood is.

My daughter had a tuna roll, which she said was also delicious. The sushi is always fresh and tasty at Ben Gui. My daughter decided to get something called the 2010 appetizer with salmon skin, shrimp, skinny noodles, roe.It was nothing like I expected - so tasty - loved the light crunch of the salmon with the soft noodles.

Some places only offer 1-3 kinds at a buffet. They had at least 6 and the man preparing the sushi said he would make the rolls with whatever we wanted!The staff was friendly, kept our glasses full. In my place coffee cup full. And their coffee tasted so fresh and robust I was tempted to ask them what brand they used.The utensils were clean as well as the table and plates. They had a great variety of Chinese and American foods; pot roast, fries, Mac & cheese etc. Salad bar with fruits and veggies.I was too full for dessert but the people around us were raving about the brownies and fudge.A wonderful family priced restaurant that leaves you feeling good, like you want to sit back and close your eyes.Looking forward to returning soon!",Sunday,"['my', 'friend', 'were', 'looking', 'for', 'a', 'place', 'to', 'go', 'for', 'lunch', 'we', 'both', 'love', 'chinese', 'but', 'im', 'more', 'a', 'sushi', 'fan', 'and', 'he', 'the', 'americanized', 'chinese', 'food', 'we', 'both', 'love', 'buffets', 'so', 'you', 'can', 'pick', 'and', 'choose', 'the', 'buffet', 'was', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'largest', 'ive', 'seen', 'in', 'a', 'long', 'time', '6', 'kids=buffets', 'the', 'food', 'was', 'fresh', 'hot', 'the', 'near', 'empty', 'bowls', 'were', 'refilled', 'quickly.the', 'sushi', 'was', 'excellent', 'a', 'good', 'variety', 'some', 'places', 'only', 'offer', '1-3', 'kinds', 'at', 'a', 'buffet', 'they', 'had', 'at', 'least', '6', 'and', 'the', 'man', 'preparing', 'the', 'sushi', 'said', 'he', 'would', 'make', 'the', 'rolls', 'with', 'whatever', 'we', 'wanted!the', 'staff', 'was', 'friendly', 'kept', 'our', 'glasses', 'full', 'in', 'my', 'place', 'coffee', 'cup', 'full', 'and', 'their', 'coffee', 'tasted', 'so', 'fresh', 'and', 'robust', 'i', 'was', 'tempted', 'to', 'ask', 'them', 'what', 'brand', 'they', 'used.the', 'utensils', 'were', 'clean', 'as', 'well', 'as', 'the', 'table', 'and', 'plates', 'they', 'had', 'a', 'great', 'variety', 'of', 'chinese', 'and', 'american', 'foods', 'pot', 'roast', 'fries', 'mac', '', 'cheese', 'etc', 'salad', 'bar', 'with', 'fruits', 'and', 'veggies.i', 'was', 'too', 'full', 'for', 'dessert', 'but', 'the', 'people', 'around', 'us', 'were', 'raving', 'about', 'the', 'brownies', 'and', 'fudge.a', 'wonderful', 'family', 'priced', 'restaurant', 'that', 'leaves', 'you', 'feeling', 'good', 'like', 'you', 'want', 'to', 'sit', 'back', 'and', 'close', 'your', 'eyes.looking', 'forward', 'to', 'returning', 'soon']",204,0.07352941176470588,0.0196078431372549,Positive,Yes

2017-12-08,Hibachi Grill and Supreme Buffet,2.0,SpiderEffect,"At the recommendation of someone we met in a different Japanese restaurant....we decided to give this restaurant a 'go'. Arriving at 11 am for lunch - you would expect all of the food to be fresh and prepared first thing. What we discovered was a buffet with TONS of food that was cold even though it was sitting under heat lamps in a steamer to keep warm. Let me clarify what I am saying....if you pick up stuffed mushrooms and bite into them they should be warm all the way through. Not only was the outside cold...but the inside was super cold. Sweet & Sour chicken....clearly the same. Dish after dish was extremely cold. If the food was 'fresh' and we arrived shortly after they opened....how can everything we put on our plate be cold?After the cold foods...we decided to try the Hibachi Grill. You can choose the items that you want the cook to fix for you.....rice, veggies, meats....all of it there to take to the grill. Sounds perfect ...right??? WRONG!!! When you eat Hibachi....meats are cooked longer than other sides. They are also kept separate from rice, veggies, eggs. Not here. They mix it all up and cook at one time. Giving the benefit of the doubt....I thought this would still turn out great. Nope....big disappointment. My rice was so hard ..I thought at first he left egg shells in my plate. Tons of super crispy pieces that you couldn't even chew. My husband picked the steak and I had chicken. I have to say...they pick the worst cuts of meat. How to you have grizzle and aren't able to chew either meat?The ice cream machine was broken and the solution was soft serve ice cream in a serve yourself method. What do I mean? A freezer with 4 flavors of ice cream, no scooper, and you take a spoon and scoop out what you would like. Now....how many hands have been in that ice cream you just scooped into a bowl? How many didn't wash their hands but put it in the ice cream??? Just gross....Dish after dish was cold....it was so surprising. The taste of a lot of the dishes made you wonder if the meat was 'iffy'. I seriously began thinking dishes were reheated or refrigerated and placed out for consumption. Not the things that you want going through your head when consuming foods that you can't tell what they are. VERY disappointed in our meal. For a buffet...it was lacking in taste, quality, and attention. Will not return to this place again.

2017-07-26,Hibachi Grill and Supreme Buffet,4.0,truefakeblonde,Let me start with the food. To say this is a supreme buffet is an understatement. You are literally greeted with rows of deliciousness. A hibachi grill that you can add whatever you like including eggs. Sushi rolls and the wazoo. Every meat you could possibly think of plus American fare. It literally has everything. I'd recommend the ice cream and skip the other desserts. They were legitimately dry and disgusting. I didn't go for the dessert so I don't care. The service. The employees are rude. Completely rude.

2018-12-23,K & W Cafeteria,2.0,CaribbeanWonderer,"This is my second review of K&W Tanglewood. The first, five years ago, related my disappointment with their 8 oz. chopped steak. Today (December 23 for lunch at 12:47pm according to the time stamp on the bill) I think I've finally convinced she who must be obeyed to opt-out of this cafeteria. She who must be obeyed (She) goes there for the shopping at a large women's-focused deep discounter next door in Tanglewood Mall. She loves K&W kale ""super food"" salad. Today, at the aforementioned time, barely into the first lunch hour, K&W had run out of the kale salad. She also loves the chicken stew (aka chicken and dumplings.) I got the usual 8 oz. chop steak. They had them stacked on their sides in the tray, (for a sad surprise later.) pan fried at some time (no grill stripes), Long gone is the large breaded onion ring on top of the 8 oz. chop steak. I noted the 5 oz version of the chop steak still layed flat in the pan, had the char-broil stripes and a dill pickle slice on top. She found nothing of interest in the veggie section, and my old favorite, pinto beans, had lost all taste except salt in the bean gravy, so I passed. Two yeast rolls, (still good, but the unpleasant surprise awaited) and that was it. 3 menu items for two and we stepped out of the serving line. K&W still has outstanding waitresses and our favorite found us and took us to her station. Still First class service from the K&W employees. But for the unpleasant surprise. My wife's chicken stew was cold. The waitress quickly took it back to the kitchen to nuke it. My chopped steak, stacked on edge in the steam tray instead of laying flat to absorb the heat from the steam tables, was likewise cold. But who hasn't eaten a cold hamburger for lunch when at work? So i continued to prepare it. The yeast rolls were not quite warm enough to melt the butter pats. No ketchup to be found at either condiment station, but the waitress brought me a bottle quickly. The taste, one of salt in the meat, and too much of that, even with the ketchup and semi-soft butter pats in the rolls.We finished our meal quickly, but not the meal of a cool salad, hot rolls and hot entrees we were expecting. Everything seemed to be pulled out of the fridge cold.

I've visited other K&W locations in other states, and the food is tasty, largely portioned, and the staff is first-class. However, both Roanoke locations don't offer that any more. The staff is mediocre -not many friendly smiles here, some of the food recipes have seemed to change over the years -not for the better, and, overall, it just seems to have lost that special touch from years ago. What happened? As far as food faves, my go-tos are usually the Baked Spaghetti or Chicken Almandine. Add to that a side of mashed potatoes and either strawberry shortcake, chocolate pie, or German chocolate pie, and I'm set. The macaroni and cheese used to be on that list too, but it's severely lost its taste. Come on, Roanoke K&W, you've got this! Work on it, because I'd love to have those tasty childhood memories flood my palate once again. As for the prices, it's typically quite affordable for the sit-down, choose-your-own, cafeteria-style cuisine.

Cold bread which is sometimes stale.

The chefs/cooks had heavily spiced several of the dishes to the point that we couldn't eat anything but the salad bar. The pot roast was so spicy it was inedible and the mixed vegetables left my mouth burning. We were afraid to try the tilapia. Let me point out that this was the first time we had experienced anything like this at this restaurant. We will go back and try the food later, but if we experience this spiciness again, we will be marking this restaurant off our list.

Food prices reflect it, won't break the bank but still higher than others, paying for the ambience I suppose. I had a fajita salad at lunch. Unfortunately the lettuce, while fresh, had a bagged salad taste. I had to search hard for grilled onions and peppers to qualify it as a fajita salad. More of those would have balanced out, and maybe hidden, the plastic taste. The beef and chicken slices were excellent. The trifecta of salsas and chips were fine, as was the service.

With it being 246 ft away from me, it's easy to say I'd eat there for convenience BUT there was a restaurant there before them and I only visited it once. I visit this establishment more than I care to admit (I like to eat ) and EVERYTHING is delicious. The best appetizer is the Pork on Pork, a sinfully delicious experience that I can't even describe. The burgers are great and the fries are to die for. I haven't had a single pasta (and I've tried them all on the menu) that I didn't like. Their fettuccine Alfredo with chicken blows Olive Garden out the water. My favorite is the Pasta A La Vodka. You will be speaking to the Lord with that one.

Both sandwiches had the wrong cheese, suppose to be Swiss. The Club was taken back , was never remade, cheese was replaced. I was told she didn't want to slice Swiss today, the person who made this. Then she went to get the Swiss for the other sandwich, I noticed there was brown lettuce, very little, and very bad mushy tomato chunk on sandwich. I asked for a box, the server said very loudly, now what's wrong. I am going to take this with me. And I put the bad vegies on a napkin, and she took it away. So I ate chips. The other was okay, the Reuben. The attitudes were awful. Never was checked on after that. The only discount we got was the drinks were not charged to the bill.

I asked for my biscuit and gravy to be heated or remade because it was cold and her response was sorry you let it sit so long, it had only been at the table 7 min tops if that. She was degrading and rude so of course I was upset, I just wanted something hot, and it wasnt even room temperature cold it was cold, like refrigerator, cold. She kept coming back and forth to my table making rude comments and trying to belittle me every chance she got. Because she did throw away my food without asking her manager first, she was obligated to make a new one which made her more pissed at me. Every chance she got she said its coming out of my pocket. I told her several times Id pay for it, and I left her enough tip to cover menu price of the entree. Honestly do not ever want to go back and really didnt want to pay for the meal itself after that awful experience. Hope no one has the pleasure of meeting her.

The two of us stopped by for an early dinner at 5PM on a Wednesday and were immediately greeted and seated; we were the only customers at that time. The interior looked rather sleek and spartan, with notes suggestive of Thailand. Their appeared to be about 20 tables as well as seats at the bar area. We were pleased to find that their extensive menu, which included some choices from other countries near Thailand, was identical to what was posted on the restaurant's website. Our Summer Roll app had fresh vegetables wrapped in iceberg lettuce and rice paper. The Pad Thai chicken, which is a dish that I learned to make during a cooking class in Bangkok, and which I often order at restaurants, did differ a bit from what I was accustomed to; it had fewer ingredients (did not detect bamboo shoots, tofu, or egg) and was considerably sweeter. The Green Curry was the star of our meal; boldly spiced, full flavored, with firm bits of Thai eggplant and fresh basil. Interestingly, we recognized our waiter, whose name we did not catch, from the nearby Thai Continental restaurant; he explained that he was happy that he changed (he may be the owner as well).

2019-08-06,El Toreo,3.0,Jackie1947_65,"Very nice Mexican decor throughout the restaurant. Wonderful smell as you walk in. The white sauce was very good. I ordered a number 2 combo dinner. This was supposed to be a taco, burrito and chalupo. I ordered water to drink. All 3 of these are high on my list of favorites when it comes to Mexican food. The taco was fine, you really can't hurt a taco. The beef burrito was somewhat dry and had an usual taste that I personally did not care so much for. Now for the chalupo. First of all, I am not convinced that they gave me a chalupo. If it was, it was more on to order of a mini salad. My wife felt the same. I would not order it again. The senorita that waited on us was not very friendly. We would thank her, but get very little response back. My friend and I across the table had to ask twice to get water refills. My wife ordered a combo dinner with one of her three items being a chicken chimichanga. It came beef instead. This is strictly my opinion. Yours may be entirely different.

The side dishes we ordered and shared were the excellent. For personal taste I felt my steak which was the Rib Eye, ordered medium rare, was very salty which must be the seasoning mix.

2019-08-21,Frankie Rowland's Steakhouse,5.0,traviz,"This was my first visit to Frankie Rowland's and I must say it was a night to remember! I've been to Roanoke many times this year and for some reason had never heard about this place. Roanoke is a special place for my fiance' and I and so I decided to propose to her at the Roanoke star. When looking for a nice place to go to dinner after the proposal I found Frankie Rowland's. The reviews looked good and I had others speaking highly of it so it sounded like the perfect place for my new fiance' and I to celebrate. We were seated at a table sort of to ourselves which was nice. This is a small restaurant and if they had been crowded it would have felt a little bit like you were on top of each other but we had a small wall to one side of our table and the tables to the other side of us were empty so this made it great for an intimate dinner. Our server was a very nice lady. She took care of us really well. We started off with drinks and I had the pineapple martini. It was okay but I would have preferred it a bit sweeter. We also had a few other drinks that were good.My fiance' and I shared a filet that was quite delicious, especially with the clarified butter put on it. We also had the shrimp and lobster tail both which were very tasty. The sauce used for the shrimp was very good. On the side we had the au gratin potatoes and the brussel sprouts. These were some of the best brussel sprouts I had ever had. The glaze and bacon on them just made them so delicious! Since we had just gotten engaged they gave us a free dessert and we got the creme crme brle. My fiance' likes strawberries so we requested those and they were able to put strawberries on top. It was so good and made the end to our night very enjoyable. My only minor complaint was the coffee I got with dessert. It was very weak and not up to the level I would have expected for a restaurant of this caliber. The food here is not cheap so most people will want to reserve this for a special occasion but I would certainly recommend it anytime you want to take your significant other to a meal they will not soon forget. From start to finish they made our engagement night so much better!

Knocking off a couple points for this reason. After we finished the meal we were sitting around talking. Place had lots of open tables so it wasnt like we were taking up space. We received our bill so paid for it and continued enjoying our visit. When we asked for a refill of our drinks (just pop and sweet teas) we were told since we had cleared our bill she could not give us refills without charging us again.I really felt like ordering the drinks and taking it out of her tip. Most restaurants give out unlimited refills and even togo glasses . The idea of stopping service just cause we paid our bill put me off.They just lost a future customer over the few pennies for the refills and get a 2 star review,Wednesday,"['ok', 'have', 'mixed', 'feelings', 'so', 'will', 'start', 'off', 'with', 'the', 'good', 'food', 'was', 'very', 'good', 'on', 'everything', 'we', 'ordered', 'price', 'was', 'reasonable', 'and', 'place', 'was', 'clean', 'knocking', 'off', 'a', 'couple', 'points', 'for', 'this', 'reason', 'after', 'we', 'finished', 'the', 'meal', 'we', 'were', 'sitting', 'around', 'talking', 'place', 'had', 'lots', 'of', 'open', 'tables', 'so', 'it', 'wasnt', 'like', 'we', 'were', 'taking', 'up', 'space', 'we', 'received', 'our', 'bill', 'so', 'paid', 'for', 'it', 'and', 'continued', 'enjoying', 'our', 'visit', 'when', 'we', 'asked', 'for', 'a', 'refill', 'of', 'our', 'drinks', 'just', 'pop', 'and', 'sweet', 'teas', 'we', 'were', 'told', 'since', 'we', 'had', 'cleared', 'our', 'bill', 'she', 'could', 'not', 'give', 'us', 'refills', 'without', 'charging', 'us', 'again.i', 'really', 'felt', 'like', 'ordering', 'the', 'drinks', 'and', 'taking', 'it', 'out', 'of', 'her', 'tip', 'most', 'restaurants', 'give', 'out', 'unlimited', 'refills', 'and', 'even', 'togo', 'glasses', '', 'the', 'idea', 'of', 'stopping', 'service', 'just', 'cause', 'we', 'paid', 'our', 'bill', 'put', 'me', 'off.they', 'just', 'lost', 'a', 'future', 'customer', 'over', 'the', 'few', 'pennies', 'for', 'the', 'refills', 'and', 'get', 'a', '2', 'star', 'review']",161,0.08695652173913043,0.006211180124223602,Positive,Yes

2019-02-20,Sal's Italian Resturant,4.0,Trickyfae,"First walking in it seemed overly dark but after going from the entry way to the dining area it became much brighter. We were the only customers there at 5pm which in my opinion is never a good sign. There were paintings everywhere and the decor was not overly italian cheesy. The linens and glass tops were a very nice choice but the fold lines in the linens looked just lazy. We were greeted by a friendly gentleman who seated us. Our waitress came over and I immediately was questioning the place due to her bad appearance just shy of a bad drag interpretation. She was friendly but after ordering an appetizer she asked me to point it out like she didn't know the menu. When the Bruschetta Al Granchio came out it looked lovely I unfortunately was to excited to taste it that I failed at getting a photo. We ordered our food my husband got the marsala I ordered the alfredo. I had put the wine menu down to order my food and when I went to pick it back up the waitress took it away. I wasnt about to stop her one less thing on my bill I guess. Our food was delicious the marsala was a great flavor you could definitely taste the wine sauce as it has a teriyaki type flavor, and the alfredo was as expected. The waitress was well mannered and kept up with our waters. When we ordered our deserts we asked for 2 cannolis one in a box and one here. They both came in a box and by that time the waitress had disappointed me enough we paid our bill and went on our way. I think this restaurant would have been five stars if not for the server.

However, we recently learned that on Sundays, they offer free Canolis for dessert. The dining room(s) are clean and quickly bused for incoming guests. The servers are prompt and neatly dressed in uniforms. The menu is pretty standard, without much imagination or deviation from 'Americanized Italian' options. My husband got baked spaghetti, which looked and tasted like Chef Boy ArDee. I ordered what I thought was clam white sauce (only described as white sauce), but it turned out to be garlic and oil...which was ok, but not what I expected. The clams were still in shell, so clearly not mixed with the sauce. It was ok, but not what I expected and nothing to write home about. Nothing comes with the meals (such as a salad), and the roles were hard, and hardly done baking. The inside tasted very doughy.The server didn't bring up the canolis until we asked about the dessert menu. We noticed that no one in our vicinity had canolis, so perhaps they weren't offering them anymore.
